 UNK-0 
 there was no hope for him this time it was the third stroke . night 
 after night i had passed the house it was vacation time and studied 
 the UNK-340 square of window and night after night i had found it 
 UNK-340 in the same way UNK-284 and UNK-7 . if he was dead i thought 
 i would see the reflection of candles on the UNK-554 blind for i knew 
 that two candles must be set at the head of a UNK-341 . he had often said 
 to me UNK-0 " i am not long for this world " UNK-0 and i had thought his words idle . 
 now i knew they were true . every night as i UNK-84 up at the window 
 i said UNK-41 to myself the word UNK-890 . it had always UNK-224 
 UNK-784 in my ears like the word UNK-635 in the UNK-951 and the word 
 UNK-642 in the UNK-694 . but now it UNK-224 to me like the name of some 
 UNK-583 and UNK-578 being . it filled me with fear and yet i UNK-405 to 
 be UNK-221 to it and to look upon its deadly work . 
 UNK-0 
 old UNK-912 was sitting at the fire smoking when i came UNK-627 
 to UNK-255 . while my UNK-7 was UNK-612 out my UNK-758 he said as if 
 returning to some former remark of his 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no i UNK-9 say he was exactly . . . but there was something UNK-81 . . . 
 there was something UNK-651 about him . ill tell you my opinion . . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he began to UNK-9 at his pipe no doubt UNK-316 his opinion in his 
 mind . UNK-666 old fool ! when we knew him first he used to be rather 
 interesting talking of UNK-20 and UNK-768 but i soon grew tired of him 
 and his endless stories about the UNK-86 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i have my own theory about it " UNK-0 he said . UNK-0 " i think it was one of 
 those . . . UNK-702 cases . . . . but its hard to say . . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he began to UNK-9 again at his pipe without giving us his theory . my 
 uncle saw me UNK-151 and said to me 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well so your old friend is gone UNK-85 be sorry to hear . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " who ? " UNK-0 said i . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " father UNK-86 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " is he dead ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " mr . UNK-912 here has just told us . he was passing by the house . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 i knew that i was under observation so i continued eating as if the news 
 had not interested me . my uncle explained to old UNK-912 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " the UNK-13 and he were great friends . the old UNK-26 taught him a 
 great deal mind you and they say he had a great wish for him . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " god have mercy on his soul " UNK-0 said my UNK-7 UNK-515 . 
 UNK-0 
 old UNK-912 looked at me for a while . i felt that his little UNK-142 black 
 eyes were examining me but i would not satisfy him by looking up from my 
 plate . he returned to his pipe and finally UNK-339 UNK-394 into the UNK-886 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i UNK-9 like children of mine " UNK-0 he said UNK-0 " to have too much to say to 
 a man like that . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " how do you mean mr . UNK-912 ? " UNK-0 asked my UNK-7 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what i mean is " UNK-0 said old UNK-912 UNK-0 " its bad for children . my idea is 
 let a young UNK-5 run about and play with young UNK-498 of his own age and 
 not be . . . am i right jack ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " thats my principle too " UNK-0 said my uncle . UNK-0 " let him learn to box his 
 corner . thats what im always saying to that UNK-977 there take 
 exercise . why when i was a UNK-854 every morning of my life i had a cold 
 bath winter and summer . and thats what stands to me now . education 
 is all very fine and large . . . . mr . UNK-912 might take a pick of that leg 
 UNK-811 " UNK-0 he added to my UNK-7 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no no not for me " UNK-0 said old UNK-912 . 
 UNK-0 
 my UNK-7 brought the dish from the safe and put it on the table . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but why do you think its not good for children mr . UNK-912 ? " UNK-0 she 
 asked . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " its bad for children " UNK-0 said old UNK-912 UNK-0 " because their minds are so 
 UNK-770 . when children see things like that you know it has an 
 effect . . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 i UNK-816 my mouth with UNK-758 for fear i might give UNK-652 to my 
 anger . UNK-666 old UNK-652 UNK-379 ! 
 UNK-0 
 it was late when i fell UNK-314 . though i was angry with old UNK-912 for 
 UNK-777 to me as a child i UNK-555 my head to extract meaning from his 
 UNK-368 sentences . in the dark of my room i UNK-747 that i saw again 
 the heavy grey face of the UNK-65 . i drew the UNK-960 over my head 
 and tried to think of christmas . but the grey face still followed me . it 
 UNK-203 and i understood that it desired to UNK-313 something . i felt 
 my soul UNK-229 into some pleasant and UNK-347 region and there again 
 i found it waiting for me . it began to UNK-313 to me in a UNK-289 
 voice and i UNK-105 why it UNK-24 continually and why the lips were so 
 UNK-295 with UNK-976 . but then i remembered that it had died of UNK-890 
 and i felt that i too was UNK-21 UNK-27 as if to UNK-422 the UNK-353 
 of his sin . 
 UNK-0 
 the next morning after breakfast i went down to look at the little house 
 in great britain street . it was an UNK-154 shop registered under 
 the UNK-209 name of UNK-686 . the UNK-686 UNK-274 mainly of childrens 
 UNK-223 and UNK-399 and on ordinary days a notice used to hang in the 
 window saying UNK-399 recovered . no notice was visible now for 
 the UNK-435 were up . a UNK-194 bouquet was tied to the UNK-738 with 
 ribbon . two poor women and a UNK-82 boy were reading the card UNK-774 
 on the UNK-194 . i also UNK-596 and read 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  july UNK-243 UNK-506 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  the rev . james UNK-86 formerly of 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  s . UNK-25 church UNK-129 street 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  aged UNK-245 years . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  r . i . p . 
 UNK-0 
 the reading of the card UNK-235 me that he was dead and i was 
 disturbed to find myself at check . had he not been dead i would have 
 gone into the little dark room behind the shop to find him sitting in 
 his UNK-731 by the fire nearly UNK-471 in his UNK-901 . perhaps 
 my UNK-7 would have given me a packet of high UNK-550 for him and this 
 present would have UNK-934 him from his UNK-250 UNK-183 . it was always i 
 who UNK-198 the packet into his black UNK-530 for his hands UNK-515 
 too much to allow him to do this without UNK-849 half the UNK-68 about 
 the floor . even as he raised his large UNK-178 hand to his nose little 
 clouds of smoke UNK-727 through his fingers over the front of his coat . 
 it may have been these constant showers of UNK-68 which gave his ancient 
 UNK-766 UNK-829 their green UNK-238 look for the red UNK-185 
 UNK-73 as it always was with the UNK-371 of a week with which 
 he tried to brush away the fallen UNK-947 was quite UNK-520 . 
 UNK-0 
 i UNK-136 to go in and look at him but i had not the courage to knock . i 
 walked away slowly along the sunny side of the street reading all the 
 UNK-217 advertisements in the UNK-420 as i went . i found it 
 strange that neither i nor the day seemed in a UNK-210 mood and i felt 
 even UNK-776 at UNK-918 in myself a UNK-393 of freedom as if i had 
 been UNK-423 from something by his death . i UNK-105 at this for as my 
 uncle had said the night before he had taught me a great deal . he had 
 studied in the irish college in rome and he had taught me to UNK-272 
 latin properly . he had told me stories about the UNK-297 and about 
 UNK-471 UNK-271 and he had explained to me the meaning of the 
 different UNK-538 of the mass and of the different UNK-272 worn 
 by the priest . sometimes he had UNK-820 himself by putting difficult 
 questions to me asking me what one should do in certain circumstances 
 or whether such and such UNK-104 were UNK-235 or UNK-429 or only 
 UNK-383 . his questions showed me how complex and mysterious were 
 certain institutions of the church which i had always regarded as 
 the UNK-208 acts . the duties of the priest towards the UNK-47 and 
 towards the UNK-957 of the UNK-948 seemed so grave to me that i 
 UNK-105 how anybody had ever found in himself the courage to undertake 
 them and i was not surprised when he told me that the fathers of the 
 church had written books as thick as the post office directory and as 
 closely printed as the law notices in the newspaper UNK-653 all 
 these UNK-49 questions . often when i thought of this i could make 
 no answer or only a very UNK-735 and UNK-370 one upon which he used 
 to smile and UNK-104 his head twice or UNK-697 . sometimes he used to put me 
 through the responses of the mass which he had made me learn by heart 
 and as i UNK-530 he used to smile UNK-927 and UNK-104 his head now and 
 then pushing huge UNK-901 of UNK-68 up each UNK-285 UNK-101 . when he 
 UNK-24 he used to UNK-491 his big UNK-302 teeth and let his tongue 
 lie upon his lower UNK-612 UNK-158 which had made me feel UNK-370 in the 
 beginning of our UNK-930 before i knew him well . 
 UNK-0 
 as i walked along in the sun i remembered old UNK-692 words and tried 
 to remember what had happened afterwards in the dream . i remembered 
 that i had noticed long velvet UNK-790 and a UNK-907 lamp of antique 
 fashion . i felt that i had been very far away in some land where the 
 customs were UNK-575 UNK-880 i thought . . . . but i could not remember 
 the end of the dream . 
 UNK-0 
 in the evening my UNK-7 took me with her to visit the house of UNK-210 . 
 it was after sunset but the UNK-493 of the houses that looked 
 to the west reflected the UNK-950 gold of a great bank of clouds . UNK-90 
 received us in the hall and as it would have been UNK-851 to have 
 UNK-247 at her my UNK-7 UNK-35 hands with her for all . the old woman 
 pointed UNK-356 UNK-319 and on my UNK-37 UNK-278 UNK-360 to 
 UNK-648 up the narrow UNK-116 before us her UNK-170 head being UNK-253 
 above the level of the UNK-903 . at the first landing she stopped 
 and UNK-53 us forward UNK-468 towards the open door of the 
 UNK-852 . my UNK-7 went in and the old woman seeing that i UNK-767 to 
 enter began to UNK-543 to me again UNK-289 with her hand . 
 UNK-0 
 i went in on UNK-649 . the room through the lace end of the blind was 
 UNK-197 with UNK-68 golden light UNK-22 which the candles looked like pale 
 thin UNK-709 . he had been UNK-564 . UNK-90 gave the lead and we three 
 UNK-97 down at the foot of the bed . i UNK-204 to pray but i could not 
 gather my thoughts because the old UNK-95 UNK-543 UNK-448 me . i 
 noticed how UNK-952 her skirt was UNK-845 at the back and how the UNK-183 
 of her cloth boots were UNK-321 down all to one side . the fancy came to 
 me that the old priest was UNK-21 as he lay there in his UNK-142 . 
 UNK-0 
 but no . when we rose and went up to the head of the bed i saw that he 
 was not UNK-21 . there he lay UNK-384 and UNK-436 UNK-534 as for the 
 UNK-92 his large hands UNK-610 UNK-129 a UNK-677 . his face was very 
 UNK-72 grey and massive with black UNK-945 UNK-304 and UNK-839 
 by a UNK-72 white fur . there was a heavy UNK-143 in the UNK-278 flowers . 
 UNK-0 
 we blessed ourselves and came away . in the little room UNK-627 we 
 found UNK-634 UNK-154 in his UNK-731 in state . i UNK-424 my way towards my 
 usual chair in the corner while UNK-90 went to the UNK-839 and brought 
 out a UNK-933 of UNK-128 and some UNK-868 . she set these on the 
 table and invited us to take a little glass of wine . then at her 
 sisters bidding she filled out the UNK-128 into the glasses and passed 
 them to us . she pressed me to take some cream UNK-854 also but i 
 declined because i thought i would make too much noise eating them . she 
 seemed to be somewhat disappointed at my UNK-592 and went over UNK-40 
 to the sofa where she sat down behind her sister . no one spoke we all 
 UNK-84 at the empty fireplace . 
 UNK-0 
 my UNK-7 UNK-56 until UNK-634 UNK-279 and then said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ah well UNK-2 gone to a better world . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-634 UNK-279 again and UNK-170 her head in UNK-338 . my UNK-7 UNK-863 the 
 stem of her UNK-933 before UNK-403 a little . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " did he . . . UNK-831 ? " UNK-0 she asked . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " oh quite UNK-831 UNK-772 " UNK-0 said UNK-634 . UNK-0 " you UNK-18 tell when the 
 breath went out of him . he had a beautiful death god be UNK-14 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and everything . . . ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " father UNK-849 was in with him a tuesday and UNK-19 him and prepared 
 him and all . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " he knew then ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " he was quite UNK-848 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " he looks quite UNK-848 " UNK-0 said my UNK-7 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " thats what the woman we had in to wash him said . she said he just 
 looked as if he was UNK-314 he looked that peaceful and UNK-848 . no one 
 would think UNK-25 make such a beautiful UNK-341 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes indeed " UNK-0 said my UNK-7 . 
 UNK-0 
 she UNK-33 a little more from her glass and said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well miss UNK-86 at any rate it must be a great comfort for you to 
 know that you did all you could for him . you were both very kind to him 
 i must say . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-634 UNK-628 her dress over her UNK-111 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ah poor james ! " UNK-0 she said . UNK-0 " god knows we done all we could as poor as 
 we UNK-53 UNK-9 see him want anything while he was in it . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-90 had UNK-122 her head against the UNK-141 and seemed about to 
 fall UNK-314 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-6 poor UNK-90 " UNK-0 said UNK-634 looking at her UNK-0 " UNK-23 UNK-71 out . all 
 the work we had she and me getting in the woman to wash him and then 
 UNK-889 him out and then the UNK-142 and then UNK-316 about the mass in 
 the chapel . only for father UNK-849 i dont know what wed have done at all . 
 it was him brought us all them flowers and them two UNK-213 out of 
 the chapel and wrote out the notice for the UNK-920 general and took 
 charge of all the papers for the cemetery and poor UNK-713 insurance . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-69 that good of him ? " UNK-0 said my UNK-7 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-634 closed her eyes and UNK-35 her head slowly . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ah UNK-6 no friends like the old friends " UNK-0 she said UNK-0 " when all is 
 said and done no friends that a body can trust . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " indeed thats true " UNK-0 said my UNK-7 . UNK-0 " and im sure now that UNK-2 gone to 
 his eternal reward he UNK-19 forget you and all your UNK-663 to him . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ah poor james ! " UNK-0 said UNK-634 . UNK-0 " he was no great trouble to us . you 
 UNK-9 hear him in the house any more than now . still i know UNK-2 
 gone and all to that . . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " its when its all over that UNK-85 miss him " UNK-0 said my UNK-7 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i know that " UNK-0 said UNK-634 . UNK-0 " i UNK-19 be bringing him in his cup of 
 UNK-721 any more nor you UNK-772 sending him his UNK-68 . ah poor james ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she stopped as if she were UNK-440 with the past and then said 
 UNK-569 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " mind you i noticed there was something UNK-81 coming over him UNK-125 . 
 whenever id bring in his soup to him there id find him with his 
 UNK-772 fallen to the floor lying back in the chair and his mouth 
 open . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she laid a finger against her nose and UNK-654 then she continued 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but still and all he kept on saying that before the summer was over 
 UNK-25 go out for a drive one fine day just to see the old house again 
 where we were all born down in UNK-736 and take me and UNK-90 with 
 him . if we could only get one of them UNK-98 UNK-411 that makes 
 no noise that father UNK-849 told him UNK-896 with the UNK-18 
 UNK-891 the day UNK-415 said at johnny UNK-698 over the way there 
 and drive out the three of us together of a sunday evening . he had his 
 mind set on that . . . . poor james ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " the lord have mercy on his soul ! " UNK-0 said my UNK-7 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-634 took out her UNK-185 and UNK-702 her eyes with it . then she put 
 it back again in her pocket and UNK-84 into the empty UNK-886 for some time 
 without speaking . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " he was too UNK-789 always " UNK-0 she said . UNK-0 " the duties of the UNK-117 
 was too much for him . and then his life was you might say UNK-112 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes " UNK-0 said my UNK-7 . UNK-0 " he was a disappointed man . you could see that . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 a silence took possession of the little room and under cover of it i 
 UNK-596 the table and UNK-561 my UNK-128 and then returned UNK-40 to 
 my chair in the UNK-911 . UNK-634 seemed to have fallen into a deep UNK-562 . 
 we UNK-56 UNK-649 for her to break the silence and after a long 
 UNK-242 she said slowly 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " it was that UNK-677 he broke . . . . that was the beginning of it . of 
 course they say it was all right that it contained nothing i mean . 
 but still . . . . they say it was the boys fault . but poor james was so 
 nervous god be UNK-607 to him ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and was that it ? " UNK-0 said my UNK-7 . UNK-0 " i heard something . . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-634 UNK-146 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " that affected his mind " UNK-0 she said . UNK-0 " after that he began to UNK-583 by 
 himself talking to no one and UNK-254 about by himself . so one night 
 he was wanted for to go on a call and they UNK-18 find him anywhere . 
 they looked high up and low down and still they UNK-18 see a sight 
 of him anywhere . so then the clerk suggested to try the chapel . so 
 then they got the keys and opened the chapel and the clerk and father 
 UNK-849 and another priest that was there brought in a light for to 
 look for him . . . . and what do you think but there he was sitting up by 
 himself in the dark in his UNK-292 UNK-706 and UNK-529 
 UNK-41 to himself ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she stopped suddenly as if to listen . i too UNK-126 but there was no 
 sound in the house and i knew that the old priest was lying still in 
 his UNK-142 as we had seen him UNK-384 and UNK-72 in death an idle 
 UNK-677 on his breast . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-634 UNK-604 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-706 and UNK-529 to himself . . . . so then of course when 
 they saw that that made them think that there was something gone wrong 
 with him . . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 an encounter 
 UNK-0 
 it was joe UNK-231 who introduced the wild west to us . he had a little 
 library made up of old numbers of the union jack UNK-397 and the 
 UNK-56 marvel . every evening after school we met in his back garden 
 and arranged indian UNK-602 . he and his fat young brother leo the 
 UNK-657 held the UNK-203 of the stable while we tried to carry it by storm 
 or we fought a UNK-199 battle on the grass . but however well we fought 
 we never won UNK-831 or battle and all our UNK-80 ended with joe UNK-661 
 war dance of victory . his parents went to UNK-198 mass every 
 morning in UNK-914 street and the peaceful UNK-143 of mrs . UNK-231 was 
 UNK-162 in the hall of the house . but he played too UNK-809 for us 
 who were younger and more UNK-183 . he looked like some kind of an indian 
 when he UNK-103 round the garden an old UNK-398 on his head UNK-570 a 
 tin with his fist and UNK-526 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ya ! UNK-487 yaka UNK-487 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 everyone was UNK-798 when it was reported that he had a UNK-765 for 
 the UNK-117 . nevertheless it was true . 
 UNK-0 
 a spirit of UNK-926 UNK-717 itself among us and under its 
 influence differences of culture and constitution were UNK-754 . we 
 UNK-247 ourselves together some UNK-258 some in UNK-545 and some almost in 
 fear and of the number of these latter the UNK-258 indians who 
 were afraid to seem UNK-239 or UNK-340 in UNK-778 i was one . the 
 adventures related in the literature of the wild west were remote from 
 my nature but at least they opened doors of escape . i liked better 
 some american detective stories which were UNK-319 from time to time 
 by UNK-846 UNK-562 and beautiful girls . though there was nothing wrong 
 in these stories and though their intention was sometimes literary 
 they were UNK-629 UNK-935 at school . one day when father butler was 
 hearing the four pages of roman history UNK-713 leo UNK-231 was discovered 
 with a copy of the UNK-56 marvel . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " this page or this page ? this page now UNK-231 up ! hardly had the 
 day . . . go on ! what day ? hardly had the day UNK-724 . . . have you studied 
 it ? what have you there in your pocket ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-657 heart UNK-152 as leo UNK-231 handed up the paper and 
 everyone assumed an innocent face . father butler turned over the pages 
 UNK-449 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what is this UNK-646 ? " UNK-0 he said . UNK-0 " the apache chief ! is this what you 
 read instead of studying your roman history ? let me not find any more 
 of this UNK-640 stuff in this college . the man who wrote it i suppose 
 was some UNK-640 fellow who writes these things for a drink . im 
 surprised at boys like you educated reading such stuff . i could 
 understand it if you were . . . national school boys . now UNK-231 i advise 
 you strongly get at your work or . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 this UNK-598 during the UNK-357 hours of school UNK-906 much of the glory of 
 the wild west for me and the confused UNK-266 face of leo UNK-231 UNK-329 
 one of my UNK-794 . but when the UNK-982 influence of the school 
 was at a distance i began to hunger again for wild UNK-259 for the 
 escape which those chronicles of disorder alone seemed to offer me . the 
 UNK-22 UNK-392 of the evening became at last as UNK-833 to me as the 
 routine of school in the morning because i wanted real adventures to 
 happen to myself . but real adventures i reflected do not happen to 
 people who remain at home they must be sought abroad . 
 UNK-0 
 the summer holidays were near at hand when i made up my mind to break 
 out of the UNK-890 of UNK-710 for one day at least . with leo UNK-231 
 and a boy named UNK-302 i planned a days UNK-844 . each of us saved up 
 UNK-547 . we were to meet at ten in the morning on the canal bridge . 
 UNK-842 big sister was to write an excuse for him and leo UNK-231 was to 
 tell his brother to say he was sick . we arranged to go along the UNK-242 
 road until we came to the ships then to cross in the UNK-854 and walk 
 out to see the UNK-61 house . leo UNK-231 was afraid we might meet father 
 butler or someone out of the college but UNK-302 asked very UNK-220 
 what would father butler be doing out at the UNK-61 house . we were 
 UNK-916 and i brought the first stage of the plot to an end by 
 collecting UNK-547 from the other two at the same time showing them 
 my own UNK-547 . when we were making the last arrangements on the eve we 
 were all UNK-489 excited . we UNK-35 hands laughing and UNK-302 said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " till tomorrow UNK-32 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 that night i UNK-613 badly . in the morning i was UNK-78 to the bridge 
 as i lived nearest . i UNK-373 my books in the long grass near the UNK-277 at 
 the end of the garden where nobody ever came and UNK-569 along the canal 
 bank . it was a mild sunny morning in the first week of june . i sat up 
 on the UNK-611 of the bridge UNK-954 my UNK-422 canvas shoes which i had 
 UNK-347 UNK-394 overnight and watching the UNK-381 horses pulling 
 a UNK-263 of business people up the hill . all the branches of the tall 
 trees which lined the mall were gay with little light green leaves and 
 the UNK-252 UNK-368 through them on to the water . the UNK-929 stone of 
 the bridge was beginning to be warm and i began to pat it with my hands 
 in time to an air in my head . i was very happy . 
 UNK-0 
 when i had been sitting there for five or ten minutes i saw UNK-842 
 grey suit UNK-781 . he came up the hill UNK-21 and UNK-655 
 up beside me on the bridge . while we were waiting he brought out 
 the UNK-258 which UNK-871 from his inner pocket and explained some 
 improvements which he had made in it . i asked him why he had brought it 
 and he told me he had brought it to have some gas with the birds . UNK-302 
 used UNK-772 freely and spoke of father butler as old UNK-378 . we UNK-56 
 on for a quarter of an hour more but still there was no sign of leo 
 UNK-231 . UNK-302 at last UNK-615 down and said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " come along . i knew UNK-648 funk it . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and his UNK-547 . . . ? " UNK-0 i said . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " thats UNK-969 " UNK-0 said UNK-302 . UNK-0 " and so much the better for usa bob and 
 a UNK-586 instead of a bob . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 we walked along the north strand road till we came to the UNK-385 works 
 and then turned to the right along the UNK-242 road . UNK-302 began to play 
 the indian as soon as we were out of public sight . he UNK-831 a crowd 
 of UNK-884 girls UNK-127 his UNK-763 UNK-258 and when two UNK-884 
 boys began out of UNK-265 to UNK-920 stones at us he proposed that we 
 should charge them . i UNK-357 that the boys were too small and so we 
 walked on the UNK-884 UNK-480 UNK-121 after us UNK-0 " UNK-700 ! 
 UNK-700 ! " UNK-0 thinking that we were UNK-949 because UNK-302 who was 
 UNK-829 UNK-71 the silver badge of a cricket club in his cap . 
 when we came to the UNK-899 iron we arranged a UNK-831 but it was a 
 failure because you must have at least three . we UNK-809 ourselves on 
 leo UNK-231 by saying what a funk he was and UNK-401 how many he would 
 get at three UNK-270 from mr . ryan . 
 UNK-0 
 we came then near the river . we spent a long time walking about the 
 UNK-132 streets UNK-69 by high stone walls watching the working of 
 UNK-312 and engines and often being UNK-247 at for our UNK-596 by the 
 drivers of UNK-388 UNK-328 . it was noon when we reached the UNK-719 and as 
 all the UNK-701 seemed to be eating their UNK-43 we bought two big 
 UNK-279 UNK-236 and sat down to eat them on some metal UNK-512 beside the 
 river . we pleased ourselves with the UNK-876 of UNK-630 UNK-945 
 UNK-514 UNK-179 from far away by their UNK-398 of UNK-471 smoke the brown 
 fishing fleet beyond UNK-220 the big white UNK-271 which was 
 being UNK-837 on the opposite UNK-118 . UNK-302 said it would be right 
 UNK-534 to run away to sea on one of those big ships and even i looking at 
 the high UNK-561 saw or UNK-747 the geography which had been UNK-416 
 UNK-673 to me at school gradually taking substance under my eyes . school 
 and home seemed to UNK-264 from us and their influences upon us seemed to 
 UNK-437 . 
 UNK-0 
 we UNK-112 the UNK-564 in the UNK-854 paying our toll to be 
 UNK-556 in the company of two UNK-701 and a little UNK-181 with a bag . 
 we were serious to the point of UNK-522 but once during the short 
 UNK-787 our eyes met and we UNK-20 . when we UNK-961 we watched the 
 UNK-69 of the UNK-231 UNK-954 which we had observed from the 
 other UNK-118 . some UNK-744 said that she was a norwegian vessel . i went 
 to the UNK-977 and tried to UNK-909 the legend upon it but failing to do 
 so i came back and examined the foreign UNK-2 to see had any of them 
 green eyes for i had some confused notion . . . . the UNK-2 eyes were 
 blue and grey and even black . the only UNK-99 whose eyes could have been 
 called green was a tall man who UNK-820 the crowd on the UNK-118 by calling 
 out UNK-929 every time the UNK-491 fell 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " all right ! all right ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 when we were tired of this sight we UNK-326 slowly into UNK-220 . the 
 day had grown UNK-434 and in the windows of the UNK-84 shops UNK-950 
 UNK-140 lay UNK-372 . we bought some UNK-140 and chocolate which 
 we ate UNK-418 as we UNK-326 through the UNK-707 streets where the 
 families of the UNK-459 live . we could find no dairy and so we went 
 into a UNK-626 shop and bought a bottle of UNK-752 UNK-543 each . 
 UNK-406 by this UNK-302 UNK-831 a cat down a lane but the cat UNK-525 
 into a wide field . we both felt rather tired and when we reached the 
 field we made at once for a UNK-576 bank over the ridge of which we 
 could see the UNK-269 . 
 UNK-0 
 it was too late and we were too tired to carry out our project of 
 visiting the UNK-61 house . we had to be home before four UNK-270 UNK-689 
 our adventure should be discovered . UNK-302 looked UNK-729 at his 
 UNK-258 and i had to suggest going home by train before he UNK-981 
 any UNK-722 . the sun went in behind some clouds and left us to our 
 UNK-901 thoughts and the UNK-936 of our provisions . 
 UNK-0 
 there was nobody but ourselves in the field . when we had UNK-89 on the 
 bank for some time without speaking i saw a man UNK-781 from the far 
 end of the field . i watched him UNK-838 as i UNK-24 one of those green 
 UNK-561 on which girls tell UNK-26 . he came along by the bank slowly . he 
 walked with one hand upon his hip and in the other hand he held a stick 
 with which he UNK-408 the UNK-474 UNK-79 . he was UNK-159 dressed in a suit 
 of UNK-779 and UNK-71 what we used to call a jerry hat with a high 
 crown . he seemed to be fairly old for his UNK-91 was UNK-235 . when 
 he passed at our feet he UNK-75 up at us quickly and then continued his 
 way . we followed him with our eyes and saw that when he had gone on for 
 perhaps fifty UNK-474 he turned about and began to UNK-834 his steps . he 
 walked towards us very slowly always UNK-451 the ground with his stick 
 so slowly that i thought he was looking for something in the grass . 
 UNK-0 
 he stopped when he came level with us and UNK-432 us UNK-42 . we answered 
 him and he sat down beside us on the slope slowly and with great care . 
 he began to talk of the weather saying that it would be a very hot 
 summer and adding that the seasons had changed greatly since he was a 
 UNK-479 long time ago . he said that the UNK-459 time of ones life was 
 UNK-590 ones UNK-413 days and that he would give anything to be 
 young again . while he expressed these UNK-187 which bored us a little 
 we kept silent . then he began to talk of school and of books . he asked 
 us whether we had read the poetry of thomas moore or the works of sir 
 walter scott and lord UNK-805 . i UNK-204 that i had read every book he 
 mentioned so that in the end he said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ah i can see you are a UNK-558 like myself . now " UNK-0 he added pointing 
 to UNK-302 who was regarding us with open eyes UNK-0 " he is different he goes 
 in for games . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he said he had all sir walter UNK-417 works and all lord UNK-87 works 
 at home and never tired of reading them . UNK-0 " of course " UNK-0 he said UNK-0 " there 
 were some of lord UNK-87 works which boys UNK-18 read . " UNK-0 UNK-302 asked 
 why UNK-18 boys read UNK-149 question which UNK-923 and UNK-588 me 
 because i was afraid the man would think i was as stupid as UNK-302 . the 
 man however only UNK-24 . i saw that he had great gaps in his mouth 
 between his yellow teeth . then he asked us which of us had the most 
 UNK-60 . UNK-302 mentioned UNK-79 that he had three UNK-125 . the man 
 asked me how many had i . i answered that i had none . he did not believe 
 me and said he was sure i must have one . i was silent . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " tell us " UNK-0 said UNK-302 UNK-175 to the man UNK-0 " how many have you yourself ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the man UNK-24 as before and said that when he was our age he had lots 
 of UNK-60 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " every boy " UNK-0 he said UNK-0 " has a little UNK-495 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 his attitude on this point struck me as UNK-784 liberal in a man 
 of his age . in my heart i thought that what he said about boys and 
 UNK-60 was reasonable . but i UNK-376 the words in his mouth and i 
 UNK-105 why he UNK-364 once or twice as if he UNK-60 something or felt 
 a sudden UNK-915 . as he UNK-360 i noticed that his accent was good . he 
 began to speak to us about girls saying what nice soft hair they had 
 and how soft their hands were and how all girls were not so good as they 
 seemed to be if one only knew . there was nothing he liked he said so 
 much as looking at a nice young girl at her nice white hands and her 
 beautiful soft hair . he gave me the impression that he was UNK-598 
 something which he had learned by heart or that UNK-494 by some 
 words of his own speech his mind was slowly UNK-748 round and round in 
 the same orbit . at times he spoke as if he were simply UNK-777 to some 
 fact that everybody knew and at times he UNK-42 his voice and spoke 
 UNK-930 as if he were telling us something secret which he did not 
 wish others to UNK-182 . he repeated his phrases over and over again 
 varying them and surrounding them with his UNK-783 voice . i continued 
 to UNK-49 towards the foot of the slope listening to him . 
 UNK-0 
 after a long while his UNK-489 UNK-214 . he stood up slowly saying 
 that he had to leave us for a minute or so a few minutes and without 
 changing the direction of my UNK-49 i saw him walking slowly away from us 
 towards the near end of the field . we remained silent when he had gone . 
 after a silence of a few minutes i heard UNK-302 UNK-897 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i say ! look what UNK-2 doing ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 as i neither answered nor raised my eyes UNK-302 UNK-751 again 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i say . . . UNK-2 a UNK-81 old UNK-531 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " in case he asks us for our names " UNK-0 i said UNK-0 " let you be murphy and ill 
 be smith . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 we said nothing further to each other . i was still considering whether 
 i would go away or not when the man came back and sat down beside us 
 again . hardly had he sat down when UNK-302 UNK-116 sight of the cat 
 which had UNK-525 him UNK-418 up and UNK-618 her across the field . the 
 man and i watched the chase . the cat UNK-525 once more and UNK-302 began 
 to throw stones at the wall she had UNK-635 . UNK-188 from this he 
 began to UNK-588 about the far end of the field UNK-33 . 
 UNK-0 
 after an interval the man spoke to me . he said that my friend was a very 
 rough boy and asked did he get UNK-628 often at school . i was going to 
 reply UNK-895 that we were not national school boys to be UNK-628 
 as he called it but i remained silent . he began to speak on the subject 
 of UNK-652 boys . his mind as if UNK-494 again by his speech 
 seemed to circle slowly round and round its new centre . he said that 
 when boys were that kind they ought to be UNK-628 and well UNK-628 . when 
 a boy was rough and UNK-886 there was nothing would do him any good but a 
 good sound UNK-370 . a UNK-387 on the hand or a box on the ear was no good 
 what he wanted was to get a nice warm UNK-370 . i was surprised at this 
 UNK-155 and UNK-594 UNK-75 up at his face . as i did so i met 
 the UNK-49 of a pair of UNK-786 eyes UNK-639 at me from under a 
 UNK-269 UNK-133 . i turned my eyes away again . 
 UNK-0 
 the man continued his UNK-489 . he seemed to have forgotten his recent 
 UNK-27 . he said that if ever he found a boy talking to girls or 
 having a girl for a UNK-495 he would UNK-422 him and UNK-422 him and that 
 would teach him not to be talking to girls . and if a boy had a girl 
 for a UNK-495 and told lies about it then he would give him such 
 a UNK-370 as no boy ever got in this world . he said that there was 
 nothing in this world he would like so well as that . he described to 
 me how he would UNK-422 such a boy as if he were UNK-549 some UNK-896 
 mystery . he would love that he said better than anything in this 
 world and his voice as he led me UNK-757 through the mystery 
 grew almost UNK-167 and seemed to UNK-400 with me that i should 
 understand him . 
 UNK-0 
 i UNK-56 till his UNK-489 UNK-214 again . then i stood up UNK-740 . UNK-689 
 i should UNK-488 my UNK-626 i delayed a few moments UNK-438 to fix 
 my shoe properly and then saying that i was UNK-499 to go i UNK-432 him 
 UNK-42 . i went up the slope UNK-331 but my heart was UNK-570 quickly 
 with fear that he would UNK-495 me by the UNK-184 . when i reached the top 
 of the slope i turned round and without looking at him called UNK-76 
 across the field 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " murphy ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 my voice had an accent of forced UNK-740 in it and i was UNK-252 of my 
 UNK-487 UNK-419 . i had to call the name again before UNK-302 saw me 
 and UNK-895 in answer . how my heart beat as he came running across the 
 field to me ! he ran as if to bring me aid . and i was UNK-197 for in my 
 heart i had always UNK-40 him a little .

 north richmond street being blind was a quiet street except at the hour 
 when the christian brothers school set the boys free . an UNK-834 
 house of two UNK-565 stood at the blind end UNK-489 from its 
 UNK-611 in a square ground the other houses of the street 
 conscious of decent lives within them UNK-84 at one another with brown 
 UNK-120 faces . 
 UNK-0 
 the former tenant of our house a priest had died in the back 
 UNK-411 . air UNK-950 from having been long enclosed hung in all 
 the rooms and the waste room behind the kitchen was UNK-641 with old 
 UNK-453 papers . among these i found a few UNK-992 books the pages 
 of which were UNK-827 and UNK-261 the UNK-548 by walter scott the UNK-636 
 UNK-230 and the UNK-747 of UNK-899 . i liked the last best because 
 its leaves were yellow . the wild garden behind the house contained a 
 central UNK-593 and a few UNK-879 UNK-818 under one of which 
 i found the late UNK-572 UNK-183 UNK-178 . he had been a very 
 charitable priest in his will he had left all his money to institutions 
 and the furniture of his house to his sister . 
 UNK-0 
 when the short days of winter came UNK-322 fell before we had well UNK-361 
 our UNK-966 . when we met in the street the houses had grown UNK-967 . the 
 space of sky above us was the colour of UNK-390 UNK-339 and towards 
 it the lamps of the street UNK-64 their UNK-879 UNK-318 . the cold air 
 UNK-257 us and we played till our bodies UNK-78 . our UNK-508 UNK-131 in the 
 silent street . the career of our play brought us through the dark UNK-249 
 lanes behind the houses where we ran the UNK-282 of the rough tribes 
 from the cottages to the back doors of the dark UNK-827 gardens where 
 UNK-940 UNK-507 from the UNK-179 to the dark UNK-4 UNK-891 where a 
 UNK-177 UNK-628 and UNK-707 the horse or UNK-35 music from the UNK-989 
 UNK-310 . when we returned to the street light from the kitchen windows 
 had filled the areas . if my uncle was seen turning the corner we UNK-373 in 
 the shadow until we had seen him safely UNK-398 . or if UNK-818 sister 
 came out on the UNK-22 to call her brother in to his tea we watched 
 her from our shadow peer up and down the street . we UNK-56 to see 
 whether she would remain or go in and if she remained we left our 
 shadow and walked up to UNK-818 steps UNK-419 . she was waiting 
 for us her figure defined by the light from the UNK-63 door . her 
 brother always UNK-193 her before he UNK-759 and i stood by the UNK-321 
 looking at her . her dress UNK-414 as she moved her body and the soft rope 
 of her hair UNK-481 from side to side . 
 UNK-0 
 every morning i lay on the floor in the front UNK-309 watching her door . 
 the blind was pulled down to within an inch of the UNK-914 so that i could 
 not be seen . when she came out on the UNK-22 my heart UNK-714 . i ran 
 to the hall UNK-457 my books and followed her . i kept her brown figure 
 always in my eye and when we came near the point at which our ways 
 UNK-699 i UNK-360 my pace and passed her . this happened morning 
 after morning . i had never spoken to her except for a few casual words 
 and yet her name was like a UNK-913 to all my UNK-735 blood . 
 UNK-0 
 her image accompanied me even in places the most UNK-719 to romance . on 
 saturday UNK-648 when my UNK-7 went marketing i had to go to carry 
 some of the UNK-879 . we walked through the UNK-611 streets UNK-237 
 by UNK-355 men and UNK-551 women UNK-22 the UNK-147 of UNK-701 the 
 UNK-367 UNK-957 of UNK-496 who stood on guard by the UNK-601 of UNK-380 
 UNK-145 the UNK-116 UNK-955 of UNK-988 who UNK-57 a UNK-224 
 about UNK-132 UNK-4 or a UNK-45 about the UNK-117 in our native 
 land . these UNK-304 UNK-927 in a single UNK-393 of life for me i 
 UNK-747 that i UNK-135 my UNK-677 safely through a UNK-352 of UNK-244 . her 
 name UNK-418 to my lips at moments in strange prayers and UNK-383 which i 
 myself did not understand . my eyes were often full of tears i could not 
 tell why and at times a flood from my heart seemed to pour itself out 
 into my UNK-186 . i thought little of the future . i did not know whether i 
 would ever speak to her or not or if i spoke to her how i could tell 
 her of my confused UNK-111 . but my body was like a UNK-31 and her words 
 and UNK-746 were like fingers running upon the wires . 
 UNK-0 
 one evening i went into the back UNK-411 in which the priest had 
 died . it was a dark UNK-726 evening and there was no sound in the house . 
 through one of the broken UNK-945 i heard the rain UNK-950 upon the earth 
 the fine UNK-551 UNK-486 of water playing in the UNK-253 beds . some 
 distant lamp or UNK-340 window UNK-834 below me . i was UNK-277 that i 
 could see so little . all my UNK-344 seemed to desire to UNK-296 themselves 
 and feeling that i was about to slip from them i pressed the UNK-976 of 
 my hands together until they UNK-515 UNK-289 UNK-0 " o love ! o love ! " UNK-0 many 
 times . 
 UNK-0 
 at last she spoke to me . when she addressed the first words to me i was 
 so confused that i did not know what to answer . she asked me was i going 
 to UNK-367 . i forgot whether i answered yes or no . it would be a UNK-288 
 UNK-315 she UNK-97 she would love to go . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and why cant you ? " UNK-0 i asked . 
 UNK-0 
 while she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and round her wrist . 
 she could not go she said because there would be a retreat that week 
 in her UNK-575 . her brother and two other boys were fighting for their 
 caps and i was alone at the UNK-321 . she held one of the UNK-253 UNK-694 
 her head towards me . the light from the lamp opposite our door caught 
 the white curve of her neck lit up her hair that UNK-346 there and 
 falling lit up the hand upon the UNK-988 . it fell over one side of her 
 dress and caught the white border of a UNK-470 just visible as she 
 stood at ease . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " its well for you " UNK-0 she said . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " if i go " UNK-0 i said UNK-0 " i will bring you something . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 what UNK-304 UNK-136 laid waste my UNK-632 and sleeping thoughts 
 after that evening ! i UNK-136 to UNK-828 the UNK-141 UNK-661 days . 
 i UNK-350 against the work of school . at night in my bedroom and by day 
 in the classroom her image came between me and the page i UNK-952 to 
 read . the UNK-500 of the word UNK-367 were called to me through the 
 silence in which my soul UNK-852 and cast an eastern UNK-555 over 
 me . i asked for leave to go to the UNK-315 on saturday night . my UNK-7 
 was surprised and hoped it was not some UNK-220 affair . i answered few 
 questions in class . i watched my masters face pass from UNK-760 to 
 UNK-259 he hoped i was not beginning to idle . i could not call my 
 UNK-254 thoughts together . i had hardly any UNK-435 with the serious 
 work of life which now that it stood between me and my desire seemed 
 to me UNK-337 play ugly UNK-783 UNK-337 play . 
 UNK-0 
 on saturday morning i UNK-610 my uncle that i UNK-136 to go to the 
 UNK-315 in the evening . he was UNK-99 at the UNK-565 looking for the 
 UNK-245 and answered me UNK-518 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes boy i know . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 as he was in the hall i could not go into the front UNK-309 and lie at 
 the window . i left the house in bad UNK-179 and walked slowly towards the 
 school . the air was UNK-551 raw and already my heart UNK-459 me . 
 UNK-0 
 when i came home to dinner my uncle had not yet been home . still it was 
 early . i sat UNK-151 at the clock for some time and when its UNK-356 
 began to UNK-645 me i left the room . i mounted the UNK-116 and 
 gained the upper part of the house . the high cold empty UNK-484 rooms 
 UNK-212 me and i went from room to room singing . from the front window 
 i saw my UNK-193 playing below in the street . their UNK-155 reached me 
 UNK-929 and UNK-398 and UNK-200 my UNK-133 against the cool glass 
 i looked over at the dark house where she lived . i may have stood 
 there for an hour seeing nothing but the UNK-996 figure cast by my 
 imagination touched UNK-456 by the UNK-963 at the UNK-773 neck at 
 the hand upon the UNK-321 and at the border below the dress . 
 UNK-0 
 when i came UNK-627 again i found mrs . UNK-440 sitting at the fire . 
 she was an old UNK-254 woman a UNK-623 UNK-265 who collected 
 used stamps for some UNK-290 purpose . i had to UNK-932 the gossip of the 
 UNK-153 . the meal was UNK-609 beyond an hour and still my uncle did 
 not come . mrs . UNK-440 stood up to go she was sorry she UNK-18 wait 
 any longer but it was after eight UNK-270 and she did not like to be 
 out late as the night air was bad for her . when she had gone i began to 
 walk up and down the room UNK-316 my UNK-177 . my UNK-7 said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " im afraid you may put off your UNK-315 for this night of our lord . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 at nine UNK-270 i heard my UNK-879 UNK-290 in the UNK-581 . i heard him 
 talking to himself and heard the UNK-565 UNK-147 when it had received 
 the weight of his UNK-319 . i could UNK-990 these signs . when he was 
 UNK-216 through his dinner i asked him to give me the money to go to the 
 UNK-315 . he had forgotten . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " the people are in bed and after their first sleep now " UNK-0 he said . 
 UNK-0 
 i did not smile . my UNK-7 said to him UNK-815 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " cant you give him the money and let him go ? UNK-628 kept him late 
 enough as it is . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 my uncle said he was very sorry he had forgotten . he said he believed in 
 the old saying UNK-0 " all work and no play makes jack a UNK-66 boy . " UNK-0 he asked 
 me where i was going and when i had told him a second time he asked me 
 did i know the UNK-366 UNK-399 to his UNK-431 . when i left the kitchen he 
 was about to UNK-754 the opening lines of the piece to my UNK-7 . 
 UNK-0 
 i held a UNK-639 UNK-651 in my hand as i UNK-536 down UNK-922 street 
 towards the station . the sight of the streets UNK-614 with buyers and 
 UNK-474 with gas UNK-225 to me the purpose of my journey . i took my 
 seat in a UNK-548 UNK-114 of a UNK-761 train . after an UNK-111 
 delay the train moved out of the station slowly . it UNK-270 UNK-90 among 
 UNK-911 houses and over the UNK-564 river . at UNK-761 row station a 
 crowd of people pressed to the UNK-114 doors but the UNK-426 moved 
 them back saying that it was a special train for the UNK-315 . i remained 
 alone in the bare UNK-114 . in a few minutes the train drew up beside an 
 UNK-359 wooden platform . i passed out on to the road and saw by the 
 UNK-340 dial of a clock that it was ten minutes to ten . in front of me 
 was a large building which displayed the magical name . 
 UNK-0 
 i could not find any UNK-717 entrance and UNK-143 that the UNK-315 
 would be closed i passed in quickly through a UNK-46 UNK-682 a 
 UNK-378 to a UNK-506 man . i found myself in a big hall UNK-857 at 
 half its height by a gallery . nearly all the UNK-778 were closed and the 
 greater part of the hall was in darkness . i recognised a silence like 
 that which UNK-731 a church after a service . i walked into the centre 
 of the UNK-315 UNK-686 . a few people were gathered about the UNK-778 which 
 were still open . before a UNK-622 over which the words cafe UNK-575 
 were written in UNK-332 lamps two men were counting money on a UNK-374 . 
 i UNK-126 to the fall of the coins . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-617 with difficulty why i had come i went over to one of the 
 UNK-778 and examined porcelain UNK-771 and UNK-644 UNK-637 . at the 
 door of the UNK-491 a young lady was talking and laughing with two young 
 UNK-32 . i UNK-957 their english UNK-122 and UNK-126 UNK-489 to 
 their conversation . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o i never said such a thing ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o but you did ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o but i UNK-3 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-3 she say that ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes . i heard her . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o UNK-6 a . . . UNK-581 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-532 me the young lady came over and asked me did i wish to buy 
 anything . the tone of her voice was not encouraging she seemed to have 
 spoken to me out of a sense of duty . i looked UNK-970 at the great UNK-146 
 that stood like eastern guards at either side of the dark entrance to 
 the UNK-491 and UNK-203 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no thank you . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the young lady changed the position of one of the UNK-771 and went back to 
 the two young men . they began to talk of the same subject . once or twice 
 the young lady UNK-75 at me over her shoulder . 
 UNK-0 
 i UNK-668 before her UNK-491 though i knew my stay was UNK-453 to make 
 my interest in her UNK-489 seem the more real . then i turned away slowly 
 and walked down the middle of the UNK-315 . i allowed the two UNK-16 to 
 fall against the UNK-547 in my pocket . i heard a voice call from one 
 end of the gallery that the light was out . the upper part of the hall 
 was now completely dark . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-248 up into the darkness i saw myself as a creature driven and 
 UNK-236 by UNK-385 and my eyes UNK-416 with UNK-644 and anger . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-967 
 UNK-0 
 she sat at the window watching the evening UNK-215 the avenue . her head 
 was UNK-122 against the window UNK-790 and in her UNK-304 was the UNK-143 
 of UNK-673 UNK-802 . she was tired . 
 UNK-0 
 few people passed . the man out of the last house passed on his way 
 home she heard his UNK-981 UNK-106 along the concrete UNK-125 and 
 afterwards UNK-584 on the UNK-592 path before the new red houses . one 
 time there used to be a field there in which they used to play every 
 evening with other peoples children . then a man from belfast bought 
 the field and built houses in UNK-935 like their little brown houses but 
 bright brick houses with UNK-160 UNK-170 . the children of the avenue used 
 to play together in that UNK-446 UNK-98 the waters the UNK-603 
 little UNK-38 the UNK-66 she and her brothers and sisters . UNK-622 
 however never played he was too grown up . her father used often to 
 hunt them in out of the field with his UNK-790 stick but usually 
 little UNK-38 used to keep UNK-382 and call out when he saw her father 
 coming . still they seemed to have been rather happy then . her father was 
 not so bad then and besides her mother was alive . that was a long time 
 ago she and her brothers and sisters were all grown up her mother 
 was dead . UNK-368 UNK-517 was dead too and the waters had gone back to 
 england . everything changes . now she was going to go away like the 
 others to leave her home . 
 UNK-0 
 home ! she looked round the room reviewing all its familiar objects 
 which she had UNK-755 once a week for so many years wondering where on 
 earth all the dust came from . perhaps she would never see again those 
 familiar objects from which she had never UNK-181 of being divided . 
 and yet during all those years she had never found out the name of the 
 priest whose UNK-438 photograph hung on the wall above the broken 
 UNK-233 beside the UNK-332 print of the promises made to blessed 
 margaret mary UNK-649 . he had been a school friend of her father . 
 whenever he showed the photograph to a visitor her father used to pass 
 it with a casual word 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " he is in melbourne now . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she had UNK-332 to go away to leave her home . was that wise ? she 
 tried to UNK-737 each side of the question . in her home anyway she had 
 shelter and food she had those whom she had known all her life about 
 her . of course she had to work hard both in the house and at business . 
 what would they say of her in the stores when they found out that she 
 had run away with a fellow ? say she was a fool perhaps and her place 
 would be filled up by advertisement . miss UNK-277 would be glad . she 
 had always had an edge on her especially whenever there were people 
 listening . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " miss hill dont you see these ladies are waiting ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " look UNK-334 miss hill please . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she would not cry many tears at leaving the stores . 
 UNK-0 
 but in her new home in a distant unknown country it would not be like 
 that . then she would be UNK-494 UNK-967 . people would treat her 
 with respect then . she would not be treated as her mother had been . even 
 now though she was over UNK-510 she sometimes felt herself in danger 
 of her fathers violence . she knew it was that that had given her the 
 UNK-958 . when they were growing up he had never gone for her like 
 he used to go for harry and UNK-622 because she was a girl but UNK-125 
 he had begun to UNK-640 her and say what he would do to her only for 
 her dead mothers sake . and now she had nobody to protect her . UNK-622 was 
 dead and harry who was in the church decorating business was nearly 
 always down somewhere in the country . besides the UNK-795 UNK-7 
 for money on saturday nights had begun to UNK-129 her UNK-241 . she 
 always gave her entire UNK-436 UNK-636 harry always sent up 
 what he could but the trouble was to get any money from her father . 
 he said she used to UNK-818 the money that she had no head that 
 he UNK-69 going to give her his UNK-919 money to throw about the 
 streets and much more for he was usually fairly bad of a saturday night . 
 in the end he would give her the money and ask her had she any intention 
 of buying UNK-822 dinner . then she had to rush out as quickly as she 
 could and do her marketing holding her black leather purse UNK-651 in 
 her hand as she UNK-542 her way through the UNK-291 and returning home 
 late under her load of provisions . she had hard work to keep the house 
 together and to see that the two young children who had been left to her 
 charge went to school regularly and got their meals regularly . it was 
 hard UNK-540 hard UNK-339 now that she was about to leave it she did 
 not find it a UNK-571 UNK-498 life . 
 UNK-0 
 she was about to explore another life with frank . frank was very kind 
 UNK-306 UNK-871 . she was to go away with him by the UNK-601 to 
 be his wife and to live with him in UNK-597 UNK-91 where he had a home 
 waiting for her . how well she remembered the first time she had seen 
 him he was lodging in a house on the main road where she used to visit . 
 it seemed a few weeks ago . he was standing at the gate his UNK-365 cap 
 pushed back on his head and his hair UNK-223 forward over a face of 
 bronze . then they had come to know each other . he used to meet her 
 outside the stores every evening and see her home . he took her to see 
 the UNK-743 girl and she felt UNK-795 as she sat in an UNK-803 part 
 of the theatre with him . he was UNK-229 UNK-345 of music and UNK-57 a little . 
 people knew that they were UNK-747 and when he UNK-57 about the UNK-341 
 that loves a UNK-99 she always felt UNK-477 confused . he used to 
 call her UNK-359 out of fun . first of all it had been an excitement for 
 her to have a fellow and then she had begun to like him . he had tales of 
 distant countries . he had started as a deck boy at a pound a month on a 
 ship of the allan line going out to canada . he told her the names of 
 the ships he had been on and the names of the different services . he had 
 UNK-497 through the UNK-455 of UNK-826 and he told her stories of the 
 terrible UNK-643 . he had fallen on his feet in UNK-597 UNK-91 he 
 said and had come over to the old country just for a holiday . of 
 course her father had found out the affair and had forbidden her to 
 have anything to say to him . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i know these UNK-99 UNK-644 " UNK-0 he said . 
 UNK-0 
 one day he had UNK-52 with frank and after that she had to meet her 
 lover UNK-935 . 
 UNK-0 
 the evening UNK-699 in the avenue . the white of two letters in her lap 
 grew UNK-398 . one was to harry the other was to her father . UNK-622 
 had been her favourite but she liked harry too . her father was becoming 
 old lately she noticed he would miss her . sometimes he could be very 
 nice . not long before when she had been laid up for a day he had read 
 her out a ghost story and made UNK-550 for her at the fire . another day 
 when their mother was alive they had all gone for a picnic to the hill 
 of UNK-301 . she remembered her father putting on her mothers UNK-843 to 
 make the children laugh . 
 UNK-0 
 her time was running out but she continued to sit by the window 
 UNK-200 her head against the window UNK-622 UNK-369 the UNK-143 of UNK-673 
 UNK-802 . down far in the avenue she could hear a street organ playing . 
 she knew the air . strange that it should come that very night to remind 
 her of the promise to her mother her promise to keep the home together 
 as long as she could . she remembered the last night of her mothers 
 illness she was again in the close dark room at the other side of the 
 hall and outside she heard a UNK-724 air of italy . the UNK-189 
 had been ordered to go away and given UNK-547 . she remembered her 
 father UNK-708 back into the UNK-219 saying 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-100 UNK-597 ! coming over here ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 as she UNK-486 the UNK-960 vision of her mothers life laid its spell on 
 the very quick of her UNK-975 life of UNK-164 UNK-626 closing 
 in final UNK-268 . she UNK-515 as she heard again her mothers voice 
 saying constantly with UNK-735 UNK-530 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-101 UNK-936 ! UNK-101 UNK-936 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she stood up in a sudden UNK-231 of terror . escape ! she must escape ! 
 frank would save her . he would give her life perhaps love too . but she 
 wanted to live . why should she be UNK-188 ? she had a right to happiness . 
 frank would take her in his arms fold her in his arms . he would save 
 her . 
 UNK-0 
 she stood among the UNK-223 crowd in the station at the north wall . he 
 held her hand and she knew that he was speaking to her saying something 
 about the passage over and over again . the station was full of soldiers 
 with brown UNK-808 . through the wide doors of the UNK-605 she caught a 
 UNK-332 of the black mass of the boat lying in beside the UNK-118 wall 
 with UNK-872 UNK-639 . she answered nothing . she felt her UNK-139 pale 
 and cold and out of a UNK-39 of UNK-127 she UNK-124 to god to direct 
 her to show her what was her duty . the boat UNK-299 a long UNK-938 
 UNK-266 into the UNK-688 . if she went tomorrow she would be on the sea 
 with frank UNK-467 towards UNK-597 UNK-91 . their passage had been 
 UNK-303 . could she still draw back after all he had done for her ? her 
 UNK-127 UNK-170 a UNK-660 in her body and she kept moving her lips in 
 silent UNK-479 prayer . 
 UNK-0 
 a bell UNK-378 upon her heart . she felt him UNK-495 her hand 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " come ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 all the seas of the world UNK-223 about her heart . he was drawing her 
 into them he would UNK-31 her . she UNK-61 with both hands at the iron 
 UNK-988 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " come ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 no ! no ! no ! it was impossible . her hands UNK-771 the iron in UNK-956 . 
 UNK-22 the seas she sent a cry of UNK-644 ! 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-967 ! UNK-197 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-939 beyond the barrier and called to her to follow . he was UNK-247 
 at to go on but he still called to her . she set her white face to him 
 passive like a UNK-41 animal . her eyes gave him no sign of love or 
 UNK-399 or recognition . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 after the race 
 UNK-0 
 the cars came UNK-264 in towards dublin running UNK-7 like UNK-676 
 in the groove of the UNK-845 road . at the crest of the hill at UNK-335 
 UNK-756 had gathered in UNK-593 to watch the cars UNK-36 UNK-94 
 and through this channel of poverty and UNK-185 the continent UNK-430 its 
 wealth and industry . now and again the UNK-593 of people raised the UNK-897 
 of the UNK-939 UNK-680 . their sympathy however was for the blue 
 UNK-160 cars of their friends the french . 
 UNK-0 
 the french moreover were virtual UNK-196 . their team had finished 
 UNK-667 they had been placed second and third and the driver of the 
 winning german car was reported a UNK-456 . each blue car therefore 
 received a double measure of welcome as it UNK-495 the crest of the hill 
 and each UNK-897 of welcome was acknowledged with UNK-479 and UNK-196 by those 
 in the car . in one of these UNK-526 built cars was a party of four 
 young men whose spirits seemed to be at present well above the level 
 of successful UNK-702 in fact these four young men were almost 
 UNK-796 . they were charles UNK-789 the owner of the car UNK-187 
 UNK-121 a young UNK-622 of canadian birth a huge hungarian named 
 UNK-857 and a UNK-969 UNK-312 young man named UNK-733 . UNK-789 was in good 
 UNK-179 because he had UNK-970 received some orders in advance he 
 was about to start a motor establishment in paris and UNK-121 was in 
 good UNK-179 because he was to be appointed manager of the establishment 
 these two young men who were UNK-565 were also in good UNK-179 because 
 of the success of the french cars . UNK-857 was in good UNK-179 because he 
 had had a very satisfactory UNK-55 and besides he was an UNK-916 by 
 nature . the fourth member of the party however was too excited to be 
 UNK-975 happy . 
 UNK-0 
 he was about UNK-482 years of age with a soft light brown UNK-91 
 and rather UNK-843 grey eyes . his father who had begun life as 
 an advanced UNK-551 had modified his views early . he had made his 
 money as a UNK-203 in UNK-894 and by opening shops in dublin and in 
 the UNK-501 he had made his money many times over . he had also been 
 UNK-460 enough to secure some of the police contracts and in the end 
 he had become rich enough to be UNK-597 to in the dublin newspapers as a 
 merchant prince . he had sent his son to england to be educated in a big 
 catholic college and had afterwards sent him to dublin university to 
 study law . jimmy did not study very UNK-519 and took to bad courses 
 for a while . he had money and he was popular and he divided his time 
 UNK-873 between musical and UNK-204 circles . then he had been sent 
 for a term to cambridge to see a little life . his father UNK-451 
 but UNK-871 proud of the excess had paid his bills and brought him 
 home . it was at cambridge that he had met UNK-789 . they were not much 
 more than UNK-670 as yet but jimmy found great pleasure in the 
 society of one who had seen so much of the world and was UNK-862 to 
 own some of the biggest hotels in france . such a person as his father 
 agreed was well worth knowing even if he had not been the charming 
 companion he was . UNK-857 was entertaining UNK-703 brilliant 
 UNK-66 unfortunately very poor . 
 UNK-0 
 the car ran on UNK-314 with its cargo of UNK-796 youth . the two 
 UNK-565 sat on the front seat jimmy and his hungarian friend sat 
 behind . UNK-837 UNK-857 was in excellent spirits he kept up a deep 
 bass UNK-897 of UNK-922 for miles of the road . the UNK-88 UNK-168 their 
 UNK-31 and light words over their UNK-61 and often jimmy had 
 to strain forward to catch the quick phrase . this was not UNK-537 
 pleasant for him as he had nearly always to make a UNK-529 guess at the 
 meaning and UNK-668 back a suitable answer in the face of a high wind . 
 besides UNK-637 UNK-997 would UNK-971 anybody the noise of the car 
 too . 
 UNK-0 
 rapid motion through space UNK-790 one so does UNK-430 so does 
 the possession of money . these were three good reasons for UNK-106 
 excitement . he had been seen by many of his friends that day in the 
 company of these UNK-206 . at the control UNK-789 had presented him 
 to one of the french competitors and in answer to his confused UNK-208 
 of UNK-805 the UNK-64 face of the driver had UNK-634 a line of 
 UNK-160 white teeth . it was pleasant after that UNK-88 to return to the 
 UNK-824 world of UNK-9 UNK-22 UNK-594 and significant looks . then as 
 to UNK-439 really had a great sum under his control . UNK-789 perhaps 
 would not think it a great sum but jimmy who in UNK-300 of temporary 
 errors was at heart the UNK-55 of solid UNK-21 knew well with 
 what difficulty it had been got together . this knowledge had previously 
 kept his bills within the limits of reasonable UNK-717 and if he 
 had been so conscious of the labour UNK-31 in money when there had been 
 question merely of some UNK-781 of the higher intelligence how much more 
 so now when he was about to stake the greater part of his substance ! it 
 was a serious thing for him . 
 UNK-0 
 of course the investment was a good one and UNK-789 had managed to give 
 the impression that it was by a favour of friendship the UNK-266 of irish 
 money was to be included in the capital of the concern . jimmy had a 
 respect for his fathers UNK-563 in business matters and in this case 
 it had been his father who had first suggested the investment money to 
 be made in the motor business UNK-313 of money . moreover UNK-789 had the 
 UNK-844 air of wealth . jimmy set out to translate into days work 
 that UNK-322 car in which he sat . how UNK-93 it ran . in what style they 
 had come UNK-36 along the country roads ! the journey laid a magical 
 finger on the genuine pulse of life and UNK-37 the machinery of human 
 UNK-510 UNK-952 to answer the UNK-295 courses of the swift blue animal . 
 UNK-0 
 they drove down dame street . the street was busy with unusual 
 traffic loud with the UNK-597 of UNK-974 and the UNK-656 of UNK-114 
 UNK-410 . near the bank UNK-789 drew up and jimmy and his friend 
 UNK-853 . a little UNK-636 of people collected on the UNK-125 to pay 
 UNK-77 to the UNK-946 motor . the party was to UNK-815 together that 
 evening in UNK-428 hotel and meanwhile jimmy and his friend who was 
 staying with him were to go home to dress . the car UNK-392 out slowly 
 for UNK-804 street while the two young men pushed their way through 
 the UNK-636 of UNK-867 . they walked UNK-973 with a curious feeling of 
 UNK-965 in the exercise while the city hung its pale UNK-636 of 
 light above them in a UNK-704 of summer evening . 
 UNK-0 
 in UNK-106 house this dinner had been UNK-363 an occasion . a certain 
 pride UNK-907 with his parents UNK-127 a certain UNK-700 also 
 to play fast and loose for the names of great foreign cities have at 
 least this virtue . jimmy too looked very well when he was dressed and 
 as he stood in the hall giving a last equation to the UNK-131 of his dress 
 tie his father may have felt even UNK-145 satisfied at having 
 secured for his son qualities often UNK-242 . his father 
 therefore was UNK-370 friendly with UNK-857 and his manner expressed 
 a real respect for foreign UNK-830 but this UNK-181 of his 
 host was probably lost upon the hungarian who was beginning to have a 
 sharp desire for his dinner . 
 UNK-0 
 the dinner was excellent UNK-32 . UNK-789 jimmy decided had a very 
 refined taste . the party was increased by a young UNK-999 named UNK-12 
 whom jimmy had seen with UNK-789 at cambridge . the young men UNK-88 in 
 a UNK-817 room lit by electric UNK-598 . they talked UNK-986 and with 
 little reserve . jimmy whose imagination was UNK-328 UNK-290 the 
 UNK-334 youth of the UNK-88 UNK-258 UNK-671 upon the firm framework 
 of the UNK-111 manner . a UNK-231 image of his he thought and a 
 just one . he UNK-336 the UNK-139 with which their host directed the 
 conversation . the five young men had various UNK-560 and their UNK-591 
 had been UNK-420 . UNK-857 with UNK-557 respect began to discover to 
 the UNK-124 surprised UNK-999 the UNK-402 of the english UNK-796 
 UNK-661 the loss of old instruments . UNK-121 not UNK-571 UNK-67 
 UNK-960 to explain to jimmy the triumph of the french UNK-35 . 
 the UNK-953 voice of the hungarian was about to UNK-210 in UNK-280 of 
 the UNK-45 UNK-273 of the romantic UNK-598 when UNK-789 UNK-682 his 
 party into politics . here was UNK-708 ground for all . jimmy under 
 generous influences felt the buried UNK-432 of his father wake to life 
 within him he UNK-754 the UNK-792 UNK-12 at last . the room grew UNK-528 
 hot and UNK-428 task grew harder each moment there was even danger 
 of personal UNK-300 . the alert host at an opportunity UNK-64 his glass 
 to humanity and when the UNK-550 had been drunk he UNK-163 open a window 
 significantly . 
 UNK-0 
 that night the city UNK-71 the mask of a capital . the five young men 
 UNK-515 along UNK-8 green in a UNK-90 cloud of UNK-262 smoke . they 
 talked UNK-76 and UNK-219 and their UNK-271 UNK-139 from their UNK-61 . 
 the people made way for them . at the corner of UNK-804 street a short 
 fat man was putting two UNK-218 ladies on a car in charge of another 
 fat man . the car drove off and the short fat man caught sight of the 
 party . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-187 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " its UNK-163 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-48 of talk followed . UNK-163 was an american . no one knew very 
 well what the talk was about . UNK-857 and UNK-121 were the UNK-965 
 but all the men were excited . they got up on a car UNK-470 themselves 
 together UNK-22 much UNK-31 . they drove by the crowd UNK-507 now into 
 soft colours to a music of merry UNK-215 . they took the train at UNK-761 
 row and in a few seconds as it seemed to jimmy they were walking out 
 of UNK-894 station . the UNK-763 UNK-276 jimmy he was an old 
 man 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " fine night sir ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 it was a UNK-587 summer night the harbour lay like a UNK-554 mirror at 
 their feet . they UNK-360 towards it with linked arms singing UNK-246 
 UNK-516 in chorus UNK-349 their feet at every 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ho ! ho ! UNK-952 UNK-312 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 they got into a UNK-864 at the slip and made out for the americans 
 yacht . there was to be UNK-255 music cards . UNK-857 said with 
 conviction 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " it is UNK-80 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 there was a yacht piano in the cabin . UNK-857 played a UNK-579 for UNK-163 
 and UNK-121 UNK-163 acting as UNK-864 and UNK-121 as lady . then 
 an UNK-795 square dance the men UNK-559 original figures . what 
 UNK-95 ! jimmy took his part with a will this was seeing life at 
 least . then UNK-163 got out of breath and UNK-5 UNK-0 " stop ! " UNK-0 a man brought in 
 a light UNK-255 and the young men sat down to it for forms sake . they 
 UNK-59 however it was UNK-743 . they UNK-59 ireland england france 
 hungary the united states of america . jimmy made a speech a long 
 speech UNK-857 saying UNK-0 " hear ! hear ! " UNK-0 whenever there was a UNK-242 . there 
 was a great UNK-374 of hands when he sat down . it must have been a good 
 speech . UNK-163 UNK-27 him on the back and UNK-20 UNK-76 . what UNK-32 
 UNK-13 ! what good company they were ! 
 UNK-0 
 cards ! cards ! the table was cleared . UNK-857 returned UNK-40 to his 
 piano and played UNK-195 for them . the other men played game after 
 game UNK-862 themselves UNK-258 into the adventure . they UNK-59 the 
 health of the queen of hearts and of the queen of diamonds . jimmy felt 
 UNK-831 the lack of an audience the wit was flashing . play ran very 
 high and paper began to pass . jimmy did not know exactly who was 
 winning but he knew that he was losing . but it was his own fault for 
 he frequently UNK-273 his cards and the other men had to calculate his 
 i UNK-336 UNK-352 UNK-464 for him . they were UNK-268 of UNK-13 but he UNK-136 they would 
 stop it was getting late . someone gave the UNK-550 of the yacht the belle 
 of newport and then someone proposed one great game for a finish . 
 UNK-0 
 the piano had stopped UNK-857 must have gone up on deck . it was a 
 terrible game . they stopped just before the end of it to drink for 
 luck . jimmy understood that the game lay between UNK-12 and UNK-789 . what 
 excitement ! jimmy was excited too he would lose of course . how much 
 had he written away ? the men rose to their feet to play the last tricks . 
 talking and UNK-14 . UNK-12 won . the cabin UNK-35 with the young 
 mens UNK-29 and the cards were UNK-448 together . they began then to 
 gather in what they had won . UNK-163 and jimmy were the UNK-706 UNK-854 . 
 UNK-0 
 he knew that he would UNK-675 in the morning but at present he was glad 
 of the rest glad of the dark UNK-435 that would cover up his UNK-813 . he 
 UNK-122 his UNK-122 on the table and UNK-346 his head between his hands 
 counting the beats of his UNK-97 . the cabin door opened and he saw the 
 hungarian standing in a shaft of grey light

 UNK-0 
 the grey warm evening of august had UNK-244 upon the city and a mild 
 warm air a memory of summer UNK-629 in the streets . the streets 
 UNK-26 for the UNK-835 of sunday UNK-876 with a UNK-219 UNK-332 crowd . 
 like UNK-872 UNK-927 the lamps UNK-493 from the UNK-871 of their tall 
 UNK-445 upon the living texture below which changing shape and UNK-641 
 UNK-967 sent up into the warm grey evening air an UNK-61 
 UNK-26 UNK-208 . 
 UNK-0 
 two young men came down the hill of UNK-192 square . one of them was just 
 bringing a long UNK-489 to a close . the other who walked on the UNK-762 
 of the path and was at times UNK-499 to step on to the road UNK-812 to 
 his UNK-193 UNK-923 UNK-71 an UNK-820 listening face . he was UNK-737 
 and UNK-259 . a UNK-968 cap was UNK-753 far back from his UNK-133 and the 
 narrative to which he UNK-126 made constant waves of expression break 
 forth over his face from the corners of his nose and eyes and mouth . 
 little jets of UNK-793 UNK-31 followed one another out of his 
 UNK-91 body . his eyes UNK-564 with UNK-650 UNK-786 UNK-75 at 
 every moment towards his UNK-193 face . once or twice he UNK-730 
 the light waterproof which he had UNK-34 over one shoulder in UNK-180 
 fashion . his UNK-468 his white rubber shoes and his UNK-315 UNK-34 
 waterproof expressed youth . but his figure fell into UNK-787 at the 
 UNK-599 his hair was UNK-231 and grey and his face when the waves of 
 expression had passed over it had a UNK-397 look . 
 UNK-0 
 when he was quite sure that the narrative had ended he UNK-20 
 UNK-963 for fully half a minute . then he said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well ! . . . that takes the UNK-979 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 his voice seemed UNK-144 of UNK-502 and to UNK-555 his words he added 
 with UNK-179 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " that takes the UNK-946 unique and if i may so call it UNK-625 
 UNK-979 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he became serious and silent when he had said this . his tongue was tired 
 for he had been talking all the afternoon in a UNK-722 in UNK-579 
 street . most people considered UNK-10 a UNK-830 but in UNK-300 of this 
 reputation his UNK-541 and UNK-118 had always UNK-128 his 
 friends from forming any general policy against him . he had a brave 
 manner of coming up to a party of them in a bar and of holding himself 
 UNK-901 at the borders of the company until he was included in a round . 
 he was a sporting UNK-126 armed with a vast stock of stories UNK-602 
 and UNK-680 . he was UNK-85 to all kinds of UNK-443 . no one 
 knew how he achieved the UNK-977 task of living but his name was UNK-489 
 associated with racing UNK-217 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and where did you pick her up UNK-62 ? " UNK-0 he asked . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-62 ran his tongue UNK-171 along his upper lip . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " one night man " UNK-0 he said UNK-0 " i was going along dame street and i UNK-305 
 a fine UNK-114 under UNK-962 clock and said UNK-274 you know . so 
 we went for a walk round by the canal and she told me she was a UNK-332 
 in a house in UNK-438 street . i put my arm round her and UNK-531 her a 
 bit that night . then next sunday man i met her by appointment . we went 
 out to UNK-661 and i brought her into a field there . she told me she 
 used to go with a UNK-146 . . . . it was fine man . cigarettes every night 
 shed bring me and paying the UNK-80 out and back . and one night she 
 brought me two bloody fine UNK-943 the real cheese you know that 
 the old fellow used to smoke . . . . i was afraid man shed get in the 
 family way . but UNK-23 up to the dodge . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " maybe she thinks UNK-85 UNK-454 her " UNK-0 said UNK-10 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i told her i was out of a job " UNK-0 said UNK-62 . UNK-0 " i told her i was in 
 UNK-899 . she UNK-55 know my name . i was too hairy to tell her that . but 
 she thinks im a bit of class you know . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-10 UNK-20 again UNK-963 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " of all the good ones ever i heard " UNK-0 he said UNK-0 " that UNK-695 takes 
 the UNK-979 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-263 UNK-767 acknowledged the UNK-805 . the swing of his UNK-548 body 
 made his friend execute a few light UNK-608 from the path to the UNK-992 
 and back again . UNK-62 was the son of an inspector of police and he had 
 inherited his fathers frame and UNK-965 . he walked with his hands by his 
 sides holding himself UNK-705 and UNK-223 his head from side to side . his 
 head was large UNK-883 and UNK-190 it UNK-488 in all UNK-730 and his 
 large round hat set upon it UNK-174 looked like a UNK-12 which had 
 grown out of another . he always UNK-156 straight before him as if he were 
 on parade and when he UNK-136 to UNK-49 after someone in the street it 
 was necessary for him to move his body from the UNK-40 . at present he was 
 about town . whenever any job was UNK-841 a friend was always ready to 
 give him the hard word . he was often to be seen walking with UNK-695 
 in plain clothes talking UNK-519 . he knew the inner side of all 
 affairs and was UNK-345 of delivering final UNK-339 . he spoke without 
 listening to the speech of his UNK-193 . his conversation was mainly 
 about himself what he had said to such a person and what such a person 
 had said to him and what he had said to settle the matter . when he 
 reported these UNK-962 he UNK-169 the first letter of his name after 
 the manner of UNK-427 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-10 offered his friend a cigarette . as the two young men walked on 
 through the crowd UNK-62 occasionally turned to smile at some of the 
 passing girls but UNK-612 UNK-49 was fixed on the large UNK-90 moon 
 UNK-839 with a double halo . he watched UNK-519 the passing of the grey 
 web of UNK-391 across its face . at length he said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well . . . tell me UNK-62 i suppose UNK-85 be able to pull it off all 
 right eh ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-62 closed one eye UNK-583 as an answer . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " is she game for that ? " UNK-0 asked UNK-10 UNK-644 . UNK-0 " you can never know 
 women . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-23 all right " UNK-0 said UNK-62 . UNK-0 " i know the way to get around her man . 
 UNK-23 a bit gone on me . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-14 what i call a gay UNK-722 " UNK-0 said UNK-10 . UNK-0 " and the proper kind 
 of a UNK-722 too ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 a shade of UNK-756 UNK-361 the UNK-890 of his manner . to save himself 
 he had the UNK-158 of leaving his UNK-510 open to the interpretation of 
 UNK-347 . but UNK-62 had not a subtle mind . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-6 nothing to touch a good UNK-332 " UNK-0 he UNK-559 . UNK-0 " take my tip for 
 it . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " by one who has tried them all " UNK-0 said UNK-10 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " first i used to go with girls you know " UNK-0 said UNK-62 UNK-640 
 UNK-0 " girls off the south circular . i used to take them out man on the 
 UNK-80 somewhere and pay the UNK-80 or take them to a band or a play at the 
 theatre or buy them chocolate and UNK-240 or something that way . i used 
 to spend money on them right enough " UNK-0 he added in a UNK-0 tone as 
 if he was conscious of being UNK-681 . 
 UNK-0 
 but UNK-10 could well believe it he UNK-146 UNK-141 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i know that game " UNK-0 he said UNK-0 " and its a UNK-903 game . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and damn the thing i ever got out of it " UNK-0 said UNK-62 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-650 here " UNK-0 said UNK-10 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " only off of one of them " UNK-0 said UNK-62 . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-335 his upper lip by running his tongue along it . the 
 UNK-141 UNK-147 his eyes . he too UNK-84 at the pale disc of the 
 moon now nearly UNK-585 and seemed to UNK-807 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " she was . . . a bit of all right " UNK-0 he said UNK-729 . 
 UNK-0 
 he was silent again . then he added 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-23 on the UNK-474 now . i saw her driving down earl street one night 
 with two UNK-13 with her on a car . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i suppose thats your doing " UNK-0 said UNK-10 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " there was others at her before me " UNK-0 said UNK-62 UNK-899 . 
 UNK-0 
 this time UNK-10 was UNK-444 to UNK-64 . he UNK-35 his head to and 
 UNK-161 and UNK-24 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " you know you cant kid me UNK-62 " UNK-0 he said . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " honest to god ! " UNK-0 said UNK-62 . UNK-0 " UNK-3 she tell me herself ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-10 made a UNK-472 UNK-359 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " base UNK-90 ! " UNK-0 he said . 
 UNK-0 
 as they passed along the UNK-321 of trinity college UNK-10 UNK-92 
 out into the road and UNK-427 up at the clock . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " twenty after " UNK-0 he said . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " time enough " UNK-0 said UNK-62 . UNK-0 " shell be there all right . i always let her 
 wait a bit . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-10 UNK-20 UNK-40 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-535 ! UNK-62 you know how to take them " UNK-0 he said . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " im up to all their little tricks " UNK-0 UNK-62 UNK-964 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but tell me " UNK-0 said UNK-10 again UNK-0 " are you sure you can bring it off 
 all right ? you know its a UNK-886 job . UNK-30 damn close on that 
 point . eh ? . . . what ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 his bright small eyes searched his UNK-193 face for UNK-523 . 
 UNK-62 UNK-414 his head to and UNK-161 as if to UNK-875 aside an UNK-74 
 UNK-23 and his UNK-490 gathered . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ill pull it off " UNK-0 he said . UNK-0 " leave it to me cant you ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-10 said no more . he did not wish to UNK-136 his friends UNK-933 to 
 be sent to the devil and told that his advice was not wanted . a little 
 UNK-159 was necessary . but UNK-263 UNK-195 was soon smooth again . his 
 thoughts were running another way . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-23 a fine decent UNK-114 " UNK-0 he said with appreciation UNK-0 " thats what she 
 is . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 they walked along UNK-279 street and then turned into UNK-328 street . not 
 far from the UNK-372 of the club a UNK-872 stood in the UNK-992 playing 
 to a little ring of UNK-797 . he UNK-347 at the wires UNK-311 
 UNK-220 quickly from time to time at the face of each UNK-226 and 
 from time to time UNK-853 also at the sky . his UNK-31 too UNK-69 
 that her UNK-49 had fallen about her UNK-111 seemed UNK-129 alike of the 
 eyes of UNK-76 and of her masters hands . one hand played in the 
 bass the UNK-922 of silent o UNK-666 while the other hand UNK-644 in the 
 UNK-400 after each group of notes . the notes of the air UNK-224 deep and 
 full . 
 UNK-0 
 the two young men walked up the street without speaking the UNK-938 
 music following them . when they reached UNK-8 green they UNK-112 the 
 road . here the noise of UNK-301 the lights and the crowd released them 
 from their silence . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " there she is ! " UNK-0 said UNK-62 . 
 UNK-0 
 at the corner of UNK-926 street a young woman was standing . she UNK-71 a blue 
 dress and a white UNK-99 hat . she stood on the UNK-526 UNK-907 a 
 UNK-554 in one hand . UNK-10 grew UNK-334 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " lets have a look at her UNK-62 " UNK-0 he said . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-62 UNK-75 UNK-174 at his friend and an UNK-144 UNK-205 appeared on 
 his face . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " are you trying to get inside me ? " UNK-0 he asked . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " damn it ! " UNK-0 said UNK-10 UNK-258 UNK-0 " i dont want an introduction . all i 
 want is to have a look at her . im not going to eat her . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o . . . a look at her ? " UNK-0 said UNK-62 more UNK-760 . UNK-0 " well . . . ill tell you 
 what . ill go over and talk to her and you can pass by . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " right ! " UNK-0 said UNK-10 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-62 had already thrown one leg over the chains when UNK-10 called 
 out 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and after ? where will we meet ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " half ten " UNK-0 answered UNK-62 bringing over his other leg . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " where ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " corner of UNK-802 street . well be coming back . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " work it all right now " UNK-0 said UNK-10 in UNK-399 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-62 did not answer . he UNK-151 across the road UNK-223 his head 
 from side to side . his bulk his easy pace and the solid sound of his 
 boots had something of the UNK-757 in them . he UNK-596 the young 
 woman and without UNK-359 began at once to UNK-401 with her . she 
 UNK-414 her UNK-148 more quickly and executed half turns on her UNK-183 . 
 once or twice when he spoke to her at close quarters she UNK-20 and 
 bent her head . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-10 observed them for a few minutes . then he walked rapidly along 
 beside the chains at some distance and UNK-112 the road UNK-543 . as he 
 UNK-596 UNK-926 street corner he found the air heavily UNK-429 and his 
 eyes made a swift UNK-860 UNK-354 of the young UNK-95 appearance . she 
 had her sunday UNK-496 on . her blue UNK-165 skirt was held at the UNK-599 by 
 a belt of black leather . the great silver UNK-905 of her belt seemed to 
 UNK-119 the centre of her body UNK-116 the light stuff of her white 
 UNK-413 like a clip . she UNK-71 a short black jacket with UNK-627 
 buttons and a UNK-884 black UNK-277 . the ends of her UNK-638 UNK-276 had 
 been carefully UNK-507 and a big bunch of red flowers was UNK-774 
 in her UNK-661 UNK-561 UNK-356 . UNK-612 eyes noted UNK-493 her UNK-98 
 short UNK-241 body . frank UNK-292 health UNK-78 in her face on her fat red 
 UNK-145 and in her UNK-191 blue eyes . her features were UNK-436 . she had 
 broad UNK-304 a UNK-879 mouth which lay open in a UNK-489 UNK-516 
 and two UNK-994 front teeth . as he passed UNK-10 took off his cap 
 and after about ten seconds UNK-62 returned a UNK-465 to the air . this 
 he did by raising his hand UNK-489 and UNK-927 changing the angle of 
 position of his hat . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-10 walked as far as the UNK-759 hotel where he UNK-46 and 
 UNK-56 . after waiting for a little time he saw them coming towards him 
 and when they turned to the right he followed them UNK-764 UNK-79 
 in his white shoes down one side of UNK-802 square . as he walked on 
 slowly timing his pace to UNK-75 he watched UNK-263 head which turned 
 at every moment towards the young UNK-95 face like a big ball UNK-700 
 on a UNK-824 . he kept the pair in view until he had seen them climbing the 
 UNK-93 of the UNK-661 UNK-80 then he turned about and went back the 
 way he had come . 
 UNK-0 
 now that he was alone his face looked older . his UNK-671 seemed to 
 UNK-582 him and as he came by the UNK-321 of the UNK-801 lawn he 
 allowed his hand to run along them . the air which the UNK-872 had played 
 began to control his movements . his UNK-41 UNK-253 feet played the UNK-922 
 while his fingers UNK-716 a scale of variations UNK-864 along the UNK-321 
 after each group of notes . 
 UNK-0 
 he walked UNK-34 round UNK-8 green and then down UNK-804 street . 
 though his eyes took note of many elements of the crowd through which 
 he passed they did so UNK-69 . he found UNK-168 all that was meant to 
 charm him and did not answer the UNK-26 which invited him to be bold . 
 he knew that he would have to speak a great deal to UNK-260 and to UNK-317 
 and his brain and throat were too dry for such a task . the problem of 
 how he could pass the hours till he met UNK-62 again UNK-371 him a 
 little . he could think of no way of passing them but to keep on walking . 
 he turned to the left when he came to the corner of UNK-192 square and 
 felt more at ease in the dark quiet street the UNK-967 look of which 
 suited his mood . he UNK-214 at last before the window of a UNK-402 
 shop over which the words UNK-732 bar were printed in white letters . 
 on the glass of the window were two flying UNK-470 UNK-534 beer and 
 UNK-534 UNK-556 . a cut ham was exposed on a great blue dish while near it 
 on a plate lay a segment of very light UNK-475 . he eyed this food 
 UNK-519 for some time and then after UNK-220 UNK-252 up and down the 
 street went into the shop quickly . 
 UNK-0 
 he was hungry for except some UNK-140 which he had asked two UNK-687 
 UNK-297 to bring him he had UNK-361 nothing since UNK-543 . he 
 sat down at an UNK-300 wooden table opposite two UNK-708 and a 
 UNK-672 . a UNK-341 girl UNK-56 on him . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " how much is a plate of peas ? " UNK-0 he asked . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " three UNK-936 sir " UNK-0 said the girl . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " bring me a plate of peas " UNK-0 he said UNK-0 " and a bottle of UNK-534 beer . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he spoke roughly in order to UNK-747 his air of UNK-33 for his entry 
 had been followed by a UNK-242 of talk . his face was heated . to appear 
 natural he pushed his cap back on his head and UNK-887 his UNK-122 on the 
 table . the UNK-672 and the two UNK-708 examined him point by point 
 before UNK-535 their conversation in a UNK-922 voice . the girl brought 
 him a plate of UNK-84 hot peas UNK-224 with pepper and UNK-112 a 
 fork and his UNK-534 beer . he ate his food UNK-631 and found it so good 
 that he made a note of the shop UNK-908 . when he had UNK-361 all the peas 
 he UNK-33 his UNK-534 beer and sat for some time thinking of UNK-263 
 adventure . in his imagination he UNK-809 the pair of lovers walking along 
 some dark road he heard UNK-263 voice in deep UNK-888 UNK-247 
 and saw again the UNK-516 of the young UNK-95 mouth . this vision made 
 him feel UNK-345 his own poverty of purse and spirit . he was tired 
 of UNK-800 about of pulling the devil by the tail of UNK-611 and 
 UNK-469 . he would be UNK-388 in november . would he never get a good 
 job ? would he never have a home of his own ? he thought how pleasant it 
 would be to have a warm fire to sit by and a good dinner to sit down to . 
 he had walked the streets long enough with friends and with girls . he 
 knew what those friends were worth he knew the girls too . experience 
 had UNK-321 his heart against the world . but all hope had not left 
 him . he felt better after having UNK-361 than he had felt before less 
 UNK-129 of his life less UNK-151 in spirit . he might yet be able to 
 settle down in some UNK-817 corner and live UNK-844 if he could only come 
 across some good UNK-836 girl with a little of the ready . 
 UNK-0 
 he paid UNK-770 UNK-56 to the UNK-341 girl and went out of the 
 shop to begin his UNK-254 again . he went into UNK-287 street and walked 
 along towards the city hall . then he turned into dame street . at the 
 corner of UNK-528 street he met two friends of his and stopped to 
 UNK-401 with them . he was glad that he could rest from all his walking . 
 his friends asked him had he seen UNK-62 and what was the latest . he 
 replied that he had spent the day with UNK-62 . his friends talked 
 very little . they looked UNK-596 after some figures in the crowd and 
 sometimes made a critical remark . one said that he had seen mac an hour 
 before in UNK-900 street . at this UNK-10 said that he had been 
 with mac the night before in UNK-905 . the young man who had seen mac 
 in UNK-900 street asked was it true that mac had won a bit over 
 a UNK-982 match . UNK-10 did not know he said that UNK-106 had stood 
 them drinks in UNK-905 . 
 UNK-0 
 he left his friends at a quarter to ten and went up UNK-528 street . 
 he turned to the left at the city markets and walked on into UNK-804 
 street . the crowd of girls and young men had UNK-84 and on his way 
 up the street he heard many groups and couples bidding one another 
 UNK-274 . he went as far as the clock of the college of surgeons it 
 was on the stroke of ten . he set off UNK-587 along the northern side 
 of the green UNK-968 for fear UNK-62 should return too soon . when he 
 reached the corner of UNK-802 street he took his stand in the shadow of 
 a lamp and brought out one of the cigarettes which he had reserved and 
 lit it . he UNK-122 against the UNK-670 and kept his UNK-49 fixed on the 
 part from which he expected to see UNK-62 and the young woman return . 
 UNK-0 
 his mind became active again . he UNK-105 had UNK-62 managed it 
 successfully . he UNK-105 if he had asked her yet or if he would leave 
 it to the last . he suffered all the UNK-352 and UNK-815 of his friends 
 situation as well as those of his own . but the memory of UNK-263 slowly 
 UNK-700 head UNK-814 him somewhat he was sure UNK-62 would pull it off 
 all right . all at once the idea struck him that perhaps UNK-62 had seen 
 her home by another way and given him the slip . his eyes searched the 
 street there was no sign of them . yet it was surely UNK-115 since 
 he had seen the clock of the college of surgeons . would UNK-62 do 
 a thing like that ? he lit his last cigarette and began to smoke it 
 UNK-409 . he UNK-434 his eyes as each UNK-80 stopped at the far corner 
 of the square . they must have gone home by another way . the paper of his 
 cigarette broke and he UNK-168 it into the road with a UNK-217 . 
 UNK-0 
 suddenly he saw them coming towards him . he started with delight and 
 keeping close to his UNK-670 tried to read the result in their walk . 
 they were walking quickly the young woman taking quick short steps 
 while UNK-62 kept beside her with his long UNK-767 . they did not seem to 
 be speaking . an UNK-799 of the result UNK-202 him like the point of a 
 sharp instrument . he knew UNK-62 would fail he knew it was no go . 
 UNK-0 
 they turned down UNK-438 street and he followed them at once taking the 
 other UNK-125 . when they stopped he stopped too . they talked for a few 
 moments and then the young woman went down the steps into the area of 
 a house . UNK-62 remained standing at the edge of the path a little 
 distance from the front steps . some minutes passed . then the UNK-581 
 was opened slowly and UNK-747 . a woman came running down the front 
 steps and UNK-137 . UNK-62 turned and went towards her . his broad figure 
 UNK-373 UNK-349 from view for a few seconds and then she UNK-256 running 
 up the steps . the door closed on her and UNK-62 began to walk UNK-171 
 towards UNK-8 green . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-10 UNK-569 on in the same direction . some drops of light rain fell . 
 he took them as a warning and UNK-220 back towards the house which the 
 young woman had entered to see that he was not observed he ran UNK-433 
 across the road . anxiety and his swift run made him UNK-718 . he called out 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-123 UNK-62 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-62 turned his head to see who had called him and then continued 
 walking as before . UNK-10 ran after him UNK-571 the waterproof on his 
 UNK-61 with one hand . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-123 UNK-62 ! " UNK-0 he UNK-5 again . 
 UNK-0 
 he came level with his friend and looked UNK-345 in his face . he could 
 see nothing there . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well ? " UNK-0 he said . UNK-0 " did it come off ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 they had reached the corner of UNK-935 place . still without answering 
 UNK-62 UNK-545 to the left and went up the side street . his features 
 were composed in UNK-977 calm . UNK-10 kept up with his friend breathing 
 UNK-523 . he was UNK-25 and a note of UNK-254 UNK-650 through his voice . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " cant you tell us ? " UNK-0 he said . UNK-0 " did you try her ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-62 UNK-46 at the first lamp and UNK-156 UNK-327 before him . then 
 with a grave UNK-359 he extended a hand towards the light and UNK-21 
 opened it slowly to the UNK-49 of his UNK-97 . a small gold coin UNK-493 in 
 the palm . 
 UNK-0

 the UNK-789 house 
 UNK-0 
 mrs . UNK-381 was a UNK-754 daughter . she was a woman who was quite 
 able to keep things to herself a determined woman . she had married her 
 fathers UNK-242 and opened a UNK-754 shop near spring gardens . but as 
 soon as his UNK-69 was dead mr . UNK-381 began to go to the devil . 
 he UNK-59 UNK-456 the till ran UNK-415 into debt . it was no use 
 making him take the pledge he was sure to break out again a few days 
 after . by fighting his wife in the presence of customers and by buying 
 bad meat he UNK-21 his business . one night he went for his wife with the 
 UNK-515 and she had to sleep in a UNK-611 house . 
 UNK-0 
 after that they lived apart . she went to the priest and got a separation 
 from him with care of the children . she would give him neither money 
 nor food nor UNK-487 and so he was UNK-499 to UNK-465 himself as a 
 UNK-296 man . he was a UNK-152 UNK-109 little UNK-27 with a white face 
 and a white UNK-91 and white UNK-993 UNK-827 above his little eyes 
 which were UNK-139 and raw and all day long he sat in the UNK-342 
 room waiting to be put on a job . mrs . UNK-381 who had taken what 
 remained of her money out of the UNK-203 business and set up a UNK-789 
 house in UNK-797 street was a big UNK-73 woman . her house had a 
 floating population made up of UNK-620 from liverpool and the isle 
 of man and occasionally UNK-842 from the music UNK-80 . its resident 
 population was made up of UNK-653 from the city . she UNK-397 her house 
 UNK-759 and UNK-419 knew when to give credit when to be UNK-977 and 
 when to let things pass . all the resident young men spoke of her as the 
 UNK-280 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mrs . UNK-989 young men paid fifteen UNK-51 a week for board and 
 UNK-671 beer or UNK-98 at dinner excluded . they shared in common 
 UNK-560 and occupations and for this reason they were very UNK-499 with 
 one another . they discussed with one another the chances of favourites 
 and UNK-347 . jack UNK-381 the UNK-196 son who was clerk to a 
 commission agent in fleet street had the reputation of being a hard 
 case . he was UNK-345 of using soldiers UNK-616 usually he came home 
 in the small hours . when he met his friends he had always a good one 
 to tell them and he was always sure to be on to a good UNK-220 is to 
 say a likely horse or a likely UNK-612 . he was also handy with the UNK-176 
 and UNK-57 comic songs . on sunday nights there would often be a reunion in 
 mrs . UNK-989 front UNK-411 . the UNK-337 UNK-842 would UNK-373 
 and UNK-801 played UNK-635 and UNK-575 and UNK-991 UNK-700 . UNK-513 
 UNK-381 the UNK-196 daughter would also sing . she UNK-57 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 im a . . . naughty girl . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 you UNK-449 UNK-352 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 you know i am . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-513 was a slim girl of UNK-510 she had light soft hair and a small 
 full mouth . her eyes which were grey with a shade of green through 
 them had a UNK-158 of UNK-220 UNK-356 when she spoke with anyone which 
 made her look like a little UNK-538 madonna . mrs . UNK-381 had first 
 sent her daughter to be a UNK-804 in a UNK-776 office but as a 
 UNK-970 UNK-296 man used to come every other day to the office 
 asking to be allowed to say a word to his daughter she had taken her 
 daughter home again and set her to do UNK-286 . as UNK-513 was very 
 UNK-334 the intention was to give her the run of the young men . besides 
 young men like to feel that there is a young woman not very far away . 
 UNK-513 of course UNK-679 with the young men but mrs . UNK-381 who was a 
 UNK-295 judge knew that the young men were only passing the time away 
 none of them meant business . things went on so for a long time and mrs . 
 UNK-381 began to think of sending UNK-513 back to UNK-945 when she 
 noticed that something was going on between UNK-513 and one of the young 
 men . she watched the pair and kept her own counsel . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-513 knew that she was being watched but still her mothers persistent 
 silence could not be UNK-105 . there had been no open UNK-337 
 between mother and daughter no open understanding but though people 
 in the house began to talk of the affair still mrs . UNK-381 did not 
 UNK-667 . UNK-513 began to grow a little strange in her manner and the 
 young man was UNK-307 UNK-522 . at last when she UNK-863 it to be the 
 right moment mrs . UNK-381 UNK-575 . she dealt with moral problems as a 
 UNK-515 deals with meat and in this case she had made up her mind . 
 UNK-0 
 it was a bright sunday morning of early summer promising heat but with 
 a fresh UNK-226 blowing . all the windows of the UNK-789 house were open 
 and the lace UNK-790 UNK-75 gently towards the street beneath the 
 raised UNK-291 . the UNK-729 of UNK-528 church sent out constant UNK-723 and 
 UNK-903 UNK-166 or in groups UNK-319 the little circus before 
 the church UNK-410 their purpose by their UNK-409 UNK-686 
 no less than by the little volumes in their UNK-354 hands . breakfast 
 was over in the UNK-789 house and the table of the UNK-54 was 
 covered with plates on which lay yellow UNK-24 of eggs with UNK-435 
 of UNK-820 and UNK-824 . mrs . UNK-381 sat in the UNK-197 UNK-731 
 and watched the UNK-363 mary remove the breakfast things . she made mary 
 collect the UNK-483 and pieces of broken bread to help to make UNK-684 
 UNK-574 . when the table was cleared the broken bread collected 
 the sugar and butter safe under lock and key she began to UNK-10 
 the interview which she had had the night before with UNK-513 . things were 
 as she had suspected she had been frank in her questions and UNK-513 had 
 been frank in her answers . both had been somewhat UNK-795 of course . 
 she had been made UNK-795 by her not wishing to receive the news in too 
 UNK-864 a fashion or to seem to have UNK-339 and UNK-513 had been 
 made UNK-795 not merely because UNK-960 of that kind always made her 
 UNK-795 but also because she did not wish it to be thought that in 
 her wise UNK-636 she had UNK-219 the intention behind her mothers 
 tolerance . 
 UNK-0 
 mrs . UNK-381 UNK-75 UNK-186 at the little UNK-294 clock on the 
 UNK-425 as soon as she had become aware through her UNK-562 that the 
 UNK-215 of UNK-528 church had stopped UNK-924 . it was UNK-538 minutes 
 past eleven she would have lots of time to have the matter out with mr . 
 UNK-259 and then catch short twelve at UNK-657 street . she was sure 
 she would win . to begin with she had all the weight of social opinion 
 on her side she was an UNK-52 mother . she had allowed him to live 
 beneath her roof assuming that he was a man of UNK-88 and he had simply 
 UNK-817 her hospitality . he was UNK-835 or UNK-859 years of age 
 so that youth could not be UNK-162 as his excuse nor could UNK-678 
 be his excuse since he was a man who had seen something of the world . he 
 had simply taken advantage of UNK-13 youth and UNK-170 that was 
 evident . the question was what UNK-434 would he make ? 
 UNK-0 
 there must be UNK-434 made in such cases . it is all very well for 
 the man he can go his ways as if nothing had happened having had his 
 moment of pleasure but the girl has to bear the UNK-302 . some mothers 
 would be content to patch up such an affair for a sum of money she had 
 known cases of it . but she would not do so . for her only one UNK-434 
 could make up for the loss of her daughters UNK-88 marriage . 
 UNK-0 
 she counted all her cards again before sending mary up to mr . UNK-695 room 
 to say that she UNK-136 to speak with him . she felt sure she would win . 
 he was a serious young man not UNK-587 or UNK-424 like the others . 
 if it had been mr . UNK-801 or mr . UNK-912 or UNK-352 UNK-152 her task would 
 have been much harder . she did not think he would face publicity . all 
 the UNK-39 in the house knew something of the affair details had been 
 UNK-480 by some . besides he had been employed for UNK-79 years in a 
 great catholic UNK-731 office and publicity would mean for him 
 perhaps the loss of his job . whereas if he agreed all might be well . 
 she knew he had a good screw for one thing and she suspected he had a 
 bit of stuff put by . 
 UNK-0 
 nearly the UNK-917 ! she stood up and UNK-423 herself in the 
 UNK-526 . the UNK-643 expression of her great UNK-451 face satisfied 
 her and she thought of some mothers she knew who could not get their 
 daughters off their hands . 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-259 was very UNK-860 indeed this sunday morning . he had made two 
 attempts to UNK-524 but his hand had been so UNK-334 that he had been 
 UNK-499 to UNK-699 . three days UNK-694 UNK-153 UNK-166 his UNK-968 and every 
 two or three minutes a UNK-688 gathered on his glasses so that he had 
 to take them off and polish them with his UNK-949 . the 
 UNK-141 of his UNK-343 of the night before was a cause of acute 
 pain to him the priest had drawn out every UNK-684 detail of the 
 affair and in the end had so UNK-81 his sin that he was almost 
 UNK-277 at being UNK-706 a UNK-186 of UNK-434 . the harm was done . 
 what could he do now but UNK-454 her or run away ? he could not UNK-271 it 
 out . the affair would be sure to be talked of and his employer would 
 be certain to hear of it . dublin is such a small city everyone knows 
 everyone UNK-117 business . he felt his heart UNK-981 UNK-807 in his throat as 
 he heard in his excited imagination old mr . leonard calling out in his 
 UNK-805 voice UNK-0 " send mr . UNK-259 here please . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 all his long years of service gone for nothing ! all his industry and 
 UNK-52 thrown away ! as a young man he had UNK-247 his wild UNK-160 of 
 course he had UNK-531 of his UNK-873 and denied the existence of 
 god to his UNK-193 in UNK-890 . but that was all passed and done 
 with . . . nearly . he still bought a copy of UNK-494 newspaper every 
 week but he attended to his religious duties and for UNK-170 of the 
 year lived a regular life . he had money enough to settle down on it was 
 not that . but the family would look down on her . first of all there 
 was her UNK-970 father and then her mothers UNK-789 house was 
 beginning to get a certain fame . he had a notion that he was being had . 
 he could imagine his friends talking of the affair and laughing . she was 
 a little UNK-314 some times she said UNK-0 " i seen " UNK-0 and UNK-0 " if i UNK-395 known . " UNK-0 
 but what would grammar matter if he really loved her ? he could not make 
 up his mind whether to like her or UNK-526 her for what she had done . of 
 course he had done it too . his UNK-375 UNK-318 him to remain free not to 
 UNK-454 . once you are married you are done for it said . 
 UNK-0 
 while he was sitting UNK-538 on the side of the bed in shirt and 
 UNK-48 she UNK-408 UNK-79 at his door and entered . she told him all 
 that she had made a clean breast of it to her mother and that her mother 
 would speak with him that morning . she UNK-5 and UNK-163 her arms round 
 his neck saying 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o bob ! bob ! what am i to do ? what am i to do at all ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she would put an end to herself she said . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-535 her UNK-27 telling her not to cry that it would be all 
 right never fear . he felt against his shirt the UNK-626 of her UNK-186 . 
 UNK-0 
 it was not UNK-537 his fault that it had happened . he remembered 
 well with the curious patient memory of the UNK-24 the first casual 
 UNK-870 her dress her breath her fingers had given him . then late one 
 night as he was UNK-808 for bed she had UNK-408 at his door UNK-686 . she 
 wanted to UNK-120 her candle at his for UNK-349 had been UNK-944 out by a 
 UNK-306 . it was her bath night . she UNK-71 a loose open UNK-417 of 
 printed UNK-491 . her white UNK-462 UNK-493 in the opening of her UNK-551 
 UNK-193 and the blood UNK-78 UNK-807 behind her UNK-630 skin . from her 
 hands and UNK-982 too as she lit and UNK-740 her candle a UNK-90 perfume 
 UNK-507 . 
 UNK-0 
 on nights when he came in very late it was she who UNK-201 up his dinner . 
 he UNK-253 knew what he was eating feeling her beside him alone at 
 night in the sleeping house . and her UNK-954 ! if the night was 
 anyway cold or wet or UNK-922 there was sure to be a little UNK-584 of 
 punch ready for him . perhaps they could be happy together . . . . 
 UNK-0 
 they used to go UNK-316 together on UNK-649 each with a candle and on 
 the third landing exchange UNK-258 UNK-942 . they used to kiss . he 
 remembered well her eyes the touch of her hand and his UNK-962 . . . . 
 UNK-0 
 but UNK-962 passes . he UNK-131 her phrase applying it to himself UNK-0 " what 
 am i to do ? " UNK-0 the UNK-375 of the UNK-24 warned him to hold back . but 
 the sin was there even his sense of UNK-88 told him that UNK-434 
 must be made for such a sin . 
 UNK-0 
 while he was sitting with her on the side of the bed mary came to the 
 door and said that the UNK-97 wanted to see him in the UNK-309 . he stood 
 up to put on his coat and UNK-187 more UNK-41 than ever . when he 
 was dressed he went over to her to comfort her . it would be all right 
 never fear . he left her UNK-273 on the bed and UNK-86 UNK-41 UNK-0 " o my 
 god ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 going down the UNK-93 his glasses became so UNK-718 with moisture that 
 he had to take them off and polish them . he UNK-405 to UNK-770 through the 
 roof and fly away to another country where he would never hear again 
 of his trouble and yet a force pushed him UNK-627 step by step . 
 the UNK-410 faces of his employer and of the UNK-280 UNK-156 upon his 
 UNK-746 . on the last flight of UNK-93 he passed jack UNK-381 who 
 was coming up from the UNK-734 nursing two bottles of bass . they UNK-276 
 UNK-482 and the lovers eyes UNK-346 for a second or two on a thick 
 UNK-230 face and a pair of thick short arms . when he reached the foot of 
 the UNK-116 he UNK-75 up and saw jack regarding him from the door of 
 the UNK-158 . 
 UNK-0 
 suddenly he remembered the night when one of the UNK-337 UNK-842 
 a little blond UNK-50 had made a rather free UNK-858 to UNK-513 . 
 the reunion had been almost broken up on account of UNK-551 violence . 
 everyone tried to quiet him . the UNK-337 UNK-612 a little UNK-230 than 
 usual kept UNK-21 and saying that there was no harm meant but jack 
 kept UNK-929 at him that if any fellow tried that sort of a game on 
 with his sister UNK-25 bloody well put his teeth down his throat so he 
 would . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-513 sat for a little time on the side of the bed UNK-273 . then she 
 dried her eyes and went over to the UNK-170 . she UNK-860 the end of 
 the UNK-186 in the UNK-489 and UNK-406 her eyes with the cool water . 
 she looked at herself in profile and UNK-85 a UNK-322 above her ear . 
 then she went back to the bed again and sat at the foot . she regarded 
 the UNK-182 for a long time and the sight of them UNK-329 in her mind 
 secret UNK-677 memories . she UNK-346 the UNK-157 of her neck against the 
 cool iron UNK-661 and fell into a UNK-807 . there was no longer any 
 UNK-292 visible on her face . 
 UNK-0 
 she UNK-56 on UNK-321 almost UNK-929 without alarm her memories 
 gradually giving place to hopes and UNK-738 of the future . her hopes and 
 UNK-738 were so UNK-49 that she no longer saw the white UNK-182 
 on which her UNK-49 was fixed or remembered that she was waiting for 
 anything . 
 UNK-0 
 at last she heard her mother calling . she started to her feet and ran to 
 the UNK-442 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-513 ! UNK-513 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes UNK-883 ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " come down dear . mr . UNK-259 wants to speak to you . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 then she remembered what she had been waiting for . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 a little cloud 
 UNK-0 
 eight years before he had seen his friend off at the north wall and 
 UNK-136 him UNK-784 . UNK-53 had got on . you could tell that at once 
 by his UNK-699 air his UNK-247 UNK-216 suit and UNK-520 accent . few 
 UNK-13 had UNK-958 like his and fewer still could remain UNK-857 
 by such success . UNK-327 heart was in the right place and he had 
 UNK-975 to win . it was something to have a friend like that . 
 UNK-0 
 little UNK-800 thoughts ever since UNK-394 had been of his meeting 
 with UNK-53 of UNK-327 invitation and of the great city london 
 where UNK-53 lived . he was called little UNK-125 because though 
 he was but slightly under the average UNK-837 he gave one the idea 
 of being a little man . his hands were white and small his frame was 
 UNK-23 his voice was quiet and his UNK-347 were refined . he took the 
 greatest care of his fair UNK-376 hair and UNK-91 and used perfume 
 UNK-456 on his UNK-185 . the UNK-361 of his nails were perfect 
 and when he UNK-24 you caught a UNK-332 of a row of UNK-191 white 
 teeth . 
 UNK-0 
 as he sat at his desk in the kings inns he thought what changes those 
 eight years had brought . the friend whom he had known under a UNK-152 and 
 UNK-895 UNK-273 had become a brilliant figure on the london press . he 
 turned often from his UNK-666 writing to UNK-49 out of the office window . 
 the glow of a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and walks . it 
 cast a shower of UNK-320 golden dust on the UNK-824 nurses and UNK-56 
 old men who UNK-53 on the UNK-674 it UNK-254 upon all the moving 
 UNK-555 the children who ran UNK-121 along the UNK-59 paths and 
 on everyone who passed through the gardens . he watched the scene and 
 thought of life and as always happened when he thought of life he 
 became sad . a gentle UNK-724 took possession of him . he felt how 
 UNK-453 it was to struggle against fortune this being the burden of 
 wisdom which the ages had UNK-767 to him . 
 UNK-0 
 he remembered the books of poetry upon his UNK-891 at home . he had 
 bought them in his bachelor days and many an evening as he sat in the 
 little room off the hall he had been UNK-508 to take one down from the 
 UNK-372 and read out something to his wife . but UNK-787 had always 
 held him back and so the books had remained on their UNK-891 . at times 
 he repeated lines to himself and this UNK-550 him . 
 UNK-0 
 when his hour had struck he stood up and took leave of his desk and of 
 his UNK-173 UNK-769 . he UNK-209 from under the UNK-684 
 arch of the kings inns a UNK-522 UNK-511 figure and walked UNK-171 down 
 UNK-8 street . the golden sunset was UNK-492 and the air had grown 
 sharp . a UNK-393 of UNK-578 children UNK-896 the street . they stood or 
 ran in the UNK-992 or UNK-344 up the steps before the UNK-775 doors or 
 UNK-202 like mice upon the UNK-899 . little UNK-125 gave them no 
 thought . he picked his way UNK-765 through all that minute UNK-104 
 life and under the shadow of the UNK-421 UNK-642 UNK-234 in which the 
 old UNK-21 of dublin had UNK-119 . no memory of the past touched him 
 for his mind was full of a present joy . 
 UNK-0 
 he had never been in UNK-104 but he knew the value of the name . he 
 knew that people went there after the theatre to eat UNK-791 and drink 
 UNK-396 and he had heard that the UNK-862 there spoke french and 
 german . walking UNK-171 by at night he had seen UNK-216 drawn up before the 
 door and UNK-861 dressed ladies UNK-666 by UNK-176 UNK-189 and 
 enter quickly . they UNK-71 UNK-132 dresses and many UNK-955 . their faces were 
 UNK-239 and they caught up their dresses when they touched earth 
 like UNK-720 UNK-786 . he had always passed without turning his head 
 to look . it was his UNK-158 to walk UNK-171 in the street even by day and 
 whenever he found himself in the city late at night he UNK-569 on his 
 way UNK-601 and UNK-92 . sometimes however he UNK-353 the 
 causes of his fear . he chose the UNK-7 and UNK-210 streets and 
 as he walked UNK-258 forward the silence that was spread about his 
 UNK-981 UNK-371 him the UNK-254 silent figures UNK-371 him and 
 at times a sound of low UNK-187 UNK-31 made him UNK-498 like a leaf . 
 UNK-0 
 he turned to the right towards UNK-287 street . UNK-77 UNK-53 on the 
 london press ! who would have thought it possible eight years before ? 
 still now that he reviewed the past little UNK-125 could remember 
 many signs of future UNK-80 in his friend . people used to say that 
 UNK-77 UNK-53 was wild . of course he did mix with a UNK-587 set of 
 UNK-13 at that time UNK-59 freely and UNK-935 money on all sides . 
 in the end he had got mixed up in some UNK-581 affair some money 
 transaction at least that was one version of his flight . but nobody 
 denied him talent . there was always a certain . . . something in UNK-77 
 UNK-53 that impressed you in UNK-300 of yourself . even when he was out 
 at UNK-122 and at his UNK-115 end for money he kept up a bold face . little 
 UNK-125 remembered and the UNK-168 brought a slight flush of pride 
 to his UNK-139 one of UNK-77 UNK-327 UNK-409 when he was in a tight 
 corner 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " half time now boys " UNK-0 he used to say UNK-10 . UNK-0 " UNK-189 my 
 considering cap ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 that was UNK-77 UNK-53 all out and damn it you UNK-18 but 
 UNK-859 him for it . 
 UNK-0 
 little UNK-125 UNK-360 his pace . for the first time in his life he 
 felt himself superior to the people he passed . for the first time his 
 soul UNK-128 against the UNK-66 UNK-243 of UNK-287 street . there was no 
 doubt about it if you wanted to succeed you had to go away . you could 
 do nothing in dublin . as he UNK-112 UNK-597 bridge he looked down the 
 river towards the lower UNK-719 and UNK-365 the poor UNK-275 houses . they 
 seemed to him a band of UNK-367 UNK-644 together along the UNK-244 
 their old UNK-811 covered with dust and UNK-676 UNK-250 by the UNK-897 
 of sunset and waiting for the first UNK-915 of night bid them arise shake 
 themselves and UNK-191 . he UNK-105 whether he could write a poem to 
 express his idea . perhaps UNK-53 might be able to get it into some 
 london paper for him . could he write something original ? he was not sure 
 what idea he UNK-136 to express but the thought that a UNK-437 moment had 
 touched him took life within him like an infant hope . he UNK-426 UNK-90 
 UNK-33 . 
 UNK-0 
 every step brought him UNK-221 to london UNK-199 from his own UNK-357 
 UNK-88 life . a light began to UNK-498 on the horizon of his mind . he 
 was not so UNK-695 . his UNK-910 might be said to be just 
 at the point of UNK-233 . there were so many different UNK-788 and 
 UNK-539 that he UNK-136 to express in verse . he felt them within him . 
 he tried UNK-737 to his soul to see if it was a UNK-485 soul . UNK-724 
 was the dominant note of his UNK-910 he thought but it was a 
 UNK-724 UNK-711 by UNK-439 of faith and UNK-247 and simple 
 joy . if he could give expression to it in a book of poems perhaps men 
 would listen . he would never be popular he saw that . he could not UNK-178 
 the crowd but he might appeal to a little circle of UNK-427 minds . 
 the english critics perhaps would UNK-156 him as one of the celtic 
 school by reason of the UNK-724 tone of his poems besides that he 
 would put in UNK-960 . he began to UNK-260 sentences and phrases from 
 the notice which his book would get . UNK-0 " mr . UNK-125 has the gift of easy 
 and UNK-231 verse . " UNK-0 . . . UNK-0 " UNK-589 UNK-750 UNK-731 these poems . " UNK-0 . . . UNK-0 " the 
 celtic note . " UNK-0 it was a UNK-47 his name was not more UNK-390 . perhaps 
 it would be better to insert his mothers name before the surname 
 thomas UNK-950 UNK-125 or better still t . UNK-950 UNK-125 . he would 
 speak to UNK-53 about it . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-618 his UNK-562 so UNK-983 that he passed his street and had 
 to turn back . as he came near UNK-104 his former UNK-626 began to 
 UNK-601 him and he UNK-46 before the door in UNK-752 . finally he 
 opened the door and entered . 
 UNK-0 
 the light and noise of the bar held him at the UNK-400 for a few 
 moments . he looked about him but his sight was confused by the UNK-160 
 of many red and green UNK-868 the bar seemed to him to be full 
 of people and he felt that the people were UNK-532 him UNK-873 . he 
 UNK-75 quickly to right and left UNK-449 slightly to make his UNK-617 
 appear serious but when his sight cleared a little he saw that nobody 
 had turned to look at him and there sure enough was UNK-77 UNK-53 
 UNK-200 with his back against the counter and his feet UNK-887 far 
 apart . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-123 tommy old hero here you are ! what is it to be ? what will you 
 have ? im taking UNK-224 better stuff than we get across the water . 
 UNK-435 ? UNK-955 ? no mineral ? im the same . UNK-66 the UNK-201 . . . . here 
 UNK-372 bring us two UNK-945 of UNK-119 UNK-224 like a good fellow . . . . well 
 and how have you been pulling along since i saw you last ? dear god 
 how old were getting ! do you see any signs of aging in UNK-528 what ? a 
 little grey and thin on the UNK-884 ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-77 UNK-53 took off his hat and displayed a large closely UNK-295 
 head . his face was heavy pale and UNK-59 . his eyes which were of 
 UNK-945 UNK-649 UNK-361 his UNK-673 UNK-917 and UNK-493 out UNK-722 
 above the UNK-606 orange tie he UNK-71 . between these UNK-907 features the 
 lips appeared very long and UNK-377 and UNK-850 . he bent his head 
 and felt with two UNK-333 fingers the thin hair at the crown . little 
 UNK-125 UNK-35 his head as a denial . UNK-77 UNK-250 put on his hat 
 again . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " it UNK-870 you down " UNK-0 he said . UNK-0 " press life . always UNK-282 and UNK-628 
 looking for copy and sometimes not finding it and then always to have 
 something new in your stuff . damn UNK-197 and printers i say for a few 
 days . im UNK-464 glad i can tell you to get back to the old country . 
 does a fellow good a bit of a holiday . i feel a ton better since i 
 UNK-961 again in dear dirty dublin . . . . here you are tommy . water ? say 
 when . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 little UNK-125 allowed his UNK-224 to be very much UNK-551 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " you dont know whats good for you my boy " UNK-0 said UNK-77 UNK-53 . UNK-0 " i 
 drink mine UNK-522 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i drink very little as a rule " UNK-0 said little UNK-125 UNK-22 . UNK-0 " an odd 
 UNK-984 or so when i meet any of the old crowd thats all . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ah well " UNK-0 said UNK-77 UNK-53 UNK-929 UNK-0 " UNK-182 to us and to old 
 times and old UNK-930 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 they UNK-338 glasses and UNK-59 the UNK-550 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i met some of the old gang today " UNK-0 said UNK-77 UNK-53 . UNK-0 " UNK-955 
 seems to be in a bad way . whats he doing ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " nothing " UNK-0 said little UNK-125 . UNK-0 " UNK-2 gone to the dogs . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but UNK-420 has a good sit UNK-696 he ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes UNK-2 in the land commission . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i met him one night in london and he seemed to be very flush . . . . poor 
 UNK-955 ! UNK-118 i suppose ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " other things too " UNK-0 said little UNK-125 shortly . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-77 UNK-53 UNK-20 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " tommy " UNK-0 he said UNK-0 " i see you UNK-204 changed an atom . UNK-14 the very 
 same serious person that used to lecture me on sunday UNK-521 when i 
 had a UNK-713 head and a fur on my tongue . UNK-306 want to knock about a bit 
 in the world . have you never been anywhere even for a trip ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-201 been to the isle of man " UNK-0 said little UNK-125 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-77 UNK-53 UNK-20 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " the isle of man ! " UNK-0 he said . UNK-0 " go to london or paris paris for choice . 
 UNK-112 do you good . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " have you seen paris ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i should think i have ! UNK-201 UNK-442 about there a little . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and is it really so beautiful as they say ? " UNK-0 asked little UNK-125 . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-33 a little of his drink while UNK-77 UNK-53 finished his 
 UNK-258 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " beautiful ? " UNK-0 said UNK-77 UNK-53 UNK-406 on the word and on the 
 UNK-201 of his drink . UNK-0 " its not so beautiful you know . of course it is 
 beautiful . . . . but its the life of paris thats the thing . ah UNK-6 
 no city like paris for UNK-671 movement excitement . . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 little UNK-125 finished his UNK-224 and after some trouble UNK-427 
 in UNK-116 the UNK-111 eye . he ordered the same again . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-201 been to the UNK-429 rouge " UNK-0 UNK-77 UNK-53 continued when the 
 UNK-375 had removed their glasses UNK-0 " and UNK-201 been to all the UNK-743 
 UNK-25 . hot stuff ! not for a UNK-290 UNK-26 like you tommy . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 little UNK-125 said nothing until the UNK-375 returned with two glasses 
 then he touched his friends glass UNK-79 and UNK-855 the former 
 UNK-550 . he was beginning to feel somewhat UNK-219 . UNK-327 
 accent and way of UNK-65 himself did not please him . there was 
 something UNK-314 in his friend which he had not observed before . but 
 perhaps it was only the result of living in london UNK-22 the UNK-527 and 
 competition of the press . the old personal charm was still there under 
 this new UNK-959 manner . and after all UNK-53 had lived he had seen 
 the world . little UNK-125 looked at his friend UNK-401 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " everything in paris is gay " UNK-0 said UNK-77 UNK-53 . UNK-0 " they believe in 
 enjoying UNK-947 dont you think UNK-30 right ? if you want to enjoy 
 yourself properly you must go to paris . and mind you UNK-67 a great 
 feeling for the irish there . when they heard i was from ireland they 
 were ready to eat me man . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 little UNK-125 took four or five UNK-385 from his glass . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " tell me " UNK-0 he said UNK-0 " is it true that paris is so . . . UNK-624 as they 
 say ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-77 UNK-53 made a catholic UNK-359 with his right arm . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " every place is UNK-624 " UNK-0 he said . UNK-0 " of course you do find UNK-263 bits in 
 paris . go to one of the students balls for instance . thats UNK-334 if 
 you like when the UNK-349 begin to let themselves loose . you know what 
 they are i suppose ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-201 heard of them " UNK-0 said little UNK-125 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-77 UNK-53 UNK-59 off his UNK-224 and UNK-35 his head . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ah " UNK-0 he said UNK-0 " you may say what you like . UNK-6 no woman like the 
 UNK-765 style for go . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " then it is an UNK-624 city " UNK-0 said little UNK-125 with UNK-183 
 UNK-530 " i mean compared with london or dublin ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " london ! " UNK-0 said UNK-77 UNK-53 . UNK-0 " its six of one and UNK-822 of 
 the other . you ask UNK-420 my boy . i showed him a bit about london when 
 he was over there . UNK-25 open your eye . . . . i say tommy dont make punch 
 of that UNK-224 UNK-246 up . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no really . . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o come on another one UNK-19 do you any harm . what is it ? the same 
 again i suppose ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well . . . all right . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-8 the same again . . . . will you smoke tommy ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-77 UNK-53 produced his UNK-883 . the two friends lit their 
 UNK-765 and UNK-484 at them in silence until their drinks were served . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ill tell you my opinion " UNK-0 said UNK-77 UNK-53 emerging after some 
 time from the clouds of smoke in which he had taken UNK-324 UNK-0 " its a UNK-647 
 world . talk of UNK-246 ! UNK-201 heard of UNK-835 am i saying UNK-122 
 known them cases of . . . UNK-246 . . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-77 UNK-53 UNK-484 UNK-711 at his UNK-455 and then in a calm 
 UNK-709 tone he UNK-360 to UNK-673 for his friend some pictures 
 of the corruption which was UNK-385 abroad . he UNK-931 the UNK-552 of many 
 UNK-686 and seemed UNK-444 to award the palm to berlin . some things he 
 could not UNK-622 for his friends had told him but of others he had had 
 personal experience . he UNK-344 neither rank nor UNK-641 . he revealed many 
 of the secrets of religious houses on the continent and described some 
 of the practices which were UNK-500 in high society and ended by 
 telling with details a story about an english UNK-974 story which 
 he knew to be true . little UNK-125 was UNK-647 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ah well " UNK-0 said UNK-77 UNK-53 UNK-0 " here we are in old UNK-603 dublin 
 where nothing is known of such things . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " how UNK-66 you must find it " UNK-0 said little UNK-125 UNK-0 " after all the other 
 places UNK-628 seen ! " UNK-0

 UNK-77 UNK-53 UNK-50 his friend UNK-84 on the back .

 UNK-0 " UNK-296 " UNK-0 he said UNK-0 " i UNK-9 doubt you tommy . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 little UNK-125 UNK-24 looked UNK-640 at his glass and bit his lower 
 lip with three UNK-188 white front teeth . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i hope UNK-85 spend an evening with us " UNK-0 he said UNK-0 " before you go

 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o in that case . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but who knows ? " UNK-0 said UNK-77 UNK-53 UNK-69 . UNK-0 " next year i may

 pleasure deferred . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0

 more now . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-77 UNK-53 took out a large gold watch and looked at it . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " is it to be the last ? " UNK-0 he said . UNK-0 " because you know i have an a UNK-507 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o yes UNK-255 " UNK-0 said little UNK-125 .

 UNK-0 " very well then " UNK-0 said UNK-77 UNK-53 UNK-0 " let us have another one as a 
 UNK-490 an UNK-600 good UNK-728 for a small UNK-224 i believe . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 little UNK-125 ordered the drinks . the UNK-801 which had UNK-482 to his 
 face a few moments before was establishing itself . a UNK-442 made 
 him UNK-801 at any time and now he felt warm and excited . three small 
 UNK-34 had gone to his head and UNK-327 strong UNK-455 had confused 
 his mind for he was a UNK-325 and UNK-40 person . the adventure of 
 meeting UNK-53 after eight years of finding himself with UNK-53 
 in UNK-104 surrounded by lights and noise of listening to UNK-327 
 stories and of sharing for a brief space UNK-327 UNK-126 and 
 UNK-258 life upset the UNK-187 of his sensitive nature . he felt 
 UNK-549 the contrast between his own life and his friends and it seemed 
 to him UNK-259 . UNK-53 was his UNK-637 in birth and education . he was 
 sure that he could do something better than his friend had ever done or 
 could ever do something higher than mere UNK-627 journalism if he only 
 got the chance . what was it that stood in his way ? his UNK-4 
 UNK-777 ! he UNK-136 to UNK-563 himself in some way to UNK-411 his 
 UNK-135 . he saw behind UNK-327 UNK-592 of his invitation . UNK-53 
 was only UNK-451 him by his UNK-99 just as he was UNK-451 
 ireland by his visit . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-375 brought their drinks . little UNK-125 pushed one glass 
 towards his friend and took up the other UNK-258 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " who knows ? " UNK-0 he said as they UNK-64 their glasses . UNK-0 " when you come next 
 year i may have the pleasure of wishing long life and happiness to mr . 
 and mrs . UNK-77 UNK-53 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-77 UNK-53 in the act of drinking closed one eye UNK-583 
 over the rim of his glass . when he had drunk he UNK-684 his lips 
 UNK-64 set down his glass and said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no UNK-403 fear of that my boy . im going to have my UNK-920 first and 
 see a bit of life and the world before i put my head in the UNK-29 i 
 ever do . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " some day you will " UNK-0 said little UNK-125 UNK-331 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-77 UNK-53 turned his orange tie and UNK-854 eyes full upon 
 his friend . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " you think so ? " UNK-0 he said . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-85 put your head in the UNK-91 " UNK-0 repeated little UNK-125 UNK-147 
 UNK-0 " like everyone else if you can find the girl . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he had slightly UNK-234 his tone and he was aware that he had 
 UNK-106 himself but though the colour had UNK-736 in his UNK-139 he 
 did not UNK-403 from his friends UNK-49 . UNK-77 UNK-53 watched him for 
 a few moments and then said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " if ever it occurs you may bet your bottom dollar UNK-63 be no 
 UNK-759 and UNK-947 about it . i mean to UNK-454 money . shell have a good 
 fat account at the bank or she UNK-19 do for me . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 little UNK-125 UNK-35 his head . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " why man alive " UNK-0 said UNK-77 UNK-53 UNK-336 UNK-0 " do you know what 
 it is ? UNK-201 only to say the word and tomorrow i can have the woman 
 and the cash . you dont believe it ? well i know it . there are 
 UNK-13 am i saying UNK-417 of rich UNK-438 and jews UNK-833 
 with money UNK-112 only be too glad . . . . you wait a while my boy . see if 
 i dont play my cards properly . when i go about a thing i mean business 
 i tell you . you just wait . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-481 his glass to his mouth finished his drink and UNK-20 UNK-76 . 
 then he looked UNK-711 before him and said in a UNK-892 tone 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but im in no UNK-282 . they can wait . i dont fancy UNK-958 myself up to 
 one woman you know . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-646 with his mouth the act of UNK-377 and made a UNK-697 face . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " must get a bit UNK-377 i should think " UNK-0 he said . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  
 UNK-0 
 little UNK-125 sat in the room off the hall holding a child in his 
 arms . to save money they kept no UNK-363 but UNK-266 young sister monica 
 came for an hour or so in the morning and an hour or so in the evening 
 to help . but monica had gone home long ago . it was a quarter to nine . 
 little UNK-125 had come home late for tea and moreover he had 
 forgotten to bring annie home the parcel of coffee from UNK-345 . of 
 course she was in a bad UNK-179 and gave him short answers . she said she 
 would do without any tea but when it came near the time at which the 
 shop at the corner closed she decided to go out herself for a quarter 
 of a pound of tea and two pounds of sugar . she put the sleeping child 
 UNK-765 in his arms and said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " here . dont UNK-698 him . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 a little lamp with a white china shade stood upon the table and its 
 light fell over a photograph which was enclosed in a frame of UNK-298 
 horn . it was UNK-266 photograph . little UNK-125 looked at it UNK-406 
 at the thin tight lips . she UNK-71 the pale blue summer UNK-413 which he 
 had brought her home as a present one saturday . it had cost him ten and 
 UNK-191 but what an UNK-386 of UNK-368 it had cost him ! how 
 he had suffered that day waiting at the shop door until the shop was 
 empty standing at the counter and trying to appear at his ease while 
 the girl UNK-664 ladies UNK-32 before him paying at the desk and 
 UNK-779 to take up the odd penny of his change being called back by 
 the UNK-367 and finally UNK-103 to hide his UNK-136 as he left the 
 shop by examining the parcel to see if it was securely tied . when he 
 brought the UNK-413 home annie UNK-166 him and said it was very pretty and 
 stylish but when she heard the price she UNK-163 the UNK-413 on the table 
 and said it was a regular UNK-970 to charge ten and UNK-191 for it . 
 at first she wanted to take it back but when she tried it on she was 
 UNK-649 with it especially with the make of the UNK-552 and UNK-166 
 him and said he was very good to think of her . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-723 ! . . . 
 UNK-0 
 he looked UNK-482 into the eyes of the photograph and they answered 
 UNK-482 . certainly they were pretty and the face itself was pretty . but 
 he found something mean in it . why was it so UNK-225 and UNK-872 ? 
 the UNK-433 of the eyes UNK-120 him . they UNK-457 him and UNK-268 
 him there was no passion in them no UNK-809 . he thought of what 
 UNK-53 had said about rich UNK-290 . those dark oriental eyes he 
 thought how full they are of passion of UNK-788 UNK-868 ! . . . why had 
 he married the eyes in the photograph ? 
 UNK-0 
 he caught himself up at the question and UNK-75 UNK-409 round the 
 room . he found something mean in the pretty furniture which he had 
 bought for his house on the hire system . annie had chosen it herself 
 and it UNK-610 him of her . it too was UNK-74 and pretty . a UNK-66 UNK-617 
 against his life UNK-170 within him . could he not escape from his little 
 house ? was it too late for him to try to live UNK-33 like UNK-53 ? 
 could he go to london ? there was the furniture still to be paid for . if 
 he could only write a book and get it published that might open the way 
 for him . 
 UNK-0 
 a volume of UNK-884 poems lay before him on the table . he opened it 
 UNK-747 with his left hand UNK-689 he should UNK-698 the child and began 
 to read the first poem in the book 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 UNK-606 are the winds and still the evening UNK-286 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 not UNK-382 a UNK-855 UNK-783 through the grove 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 whilst i return to view my UNK-945 UNK-185 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 and UNK-370 flowers on the dust i love . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-214 . he felt the rhythm of the verse about him in the room . 
 how UNK-724 it was ! could he too write like that express the 
 UNK-724 of his soul in verse ? there were so many things he wanted 
 to describe his UNK-393 of a few hours before on UNK-597 bridge for 
 example . if he could get back again into that mood . . . . 
 UNK-0 
 the child UNK-170 and began to cry . he turned from the page and tried to 
 UNK-218 it but it would not be UNK-606 . he began to rock it to and UNK-161 in 
 his arms but its UNK-829 cry grew UNK-414 . he UNK-270 it faster while his 
 eyes began to read the second UNK-47 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  within this narrow cell UNK-73 her clay 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  that clay where once . . . 
 UNK-0 
 it was UNK-453 . he UNK-18 read . he UNK-18 do anything . the UNK-829 
 of the child UNK-650 the drum of his ear . it was UNK-453 useless ! 
 he was a prisoner for life . his arms UNK-515 with anger and suddenly 
 UNK-277 to the UNK-337 face he UNK-247 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " stop ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the child stopped for an instant had a UNK-854 of UNK-512 and began to 
 UNK-509 . he UNK-615 up from his chair and walked UNK-542 up and down the 
 room with the child in his arms . it began to UNK-278 UNK-608 losing its 
 breath for four or five seconds and then UNK-412 out UNK-772 . the thin 
 walls of the room UNK-131 the sound . he tried to UNK-894 it but it UNK-78 
 more UNK-334 . he looked at the UNK-891 and UNK-106 face of 
 the child and began to be UNK-720 . he counted seven UNK-319 without a 
 break between them and caught the child to his breast in UNK-512 . if it 
 died ! . . . 
 UNK-0 
 the door was burst open and a young woman ran in UNK-572 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what is it ? what is it ? " UNK-0 she UNK-5 . 
 UNK-0 
 the child hearing its mothers voice broke out into a UNK-33 of 
 UNK-260 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " its nothing annie . . . its nothing . . . . he began to cry . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she UNK-168 her UNK-879 on the floor and UNK-112 the child from him . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what have you done to him ? " UNK-0 she UNK-5 UNK-474 into his face . 
 UNK-0 
 little UNK-125 sustained for one moment the UNK-49 of her eyes and his 
 heart closed together as he met the UNK-985 in them . he began to UNK-761 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " its nothing . . . . he . . . he began to cry . . . . i UNK-18 . . . i UNK-3 do 
 anything . . . . what ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 giving no UNK-343 to him she began to walk up and down the room UNK-621 
 the child UNK-651 in her arms and UNK-289 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " my little man ! my little UNK-371 ! was ou UNK-979 love ? . . . there 
 now love ! there now ! . . . UNK-305 ! UNK-927 little lamb of the world ! . . . 
 there now ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 little UNK-125 felt his UNK-145 UNK-197 with shame and he stood back 
 out of the UNK-963 . he UNK-126 while the UNK-33 of the UNK-337 
 UNK-260 grew less and less and tears of UNK-246 started to his eyes . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-101 
 UNK-0 
 the bell UNK-459 UNK-869 and when miss parker went to the tube a 
 UNK-942 voice called out in a UNK-533 north of ireland accent 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " send UNK-389 here ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 miss parker returned to her machine saying to a man who was writing at 
 a desk 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " mr . UNK-237 wants you UNK-316 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the man UNK-606 UNK-0 " blast him ! " UNK-0 under his breath and pushed back his chair 
 to stand up . when he stood up he was tall and of great bulk . he had a 
 hanging face dark UNK-496 with fair UNK-993 and UNK-91 
 his eyes UNK-871 forward slightly and the UNK-645 of them were dirty . 
 he UNK-64 up the counter and passing by the clients went out of the 
 office with a heavy step . 
 UNK-0 
 he went heavily UNK-316 until he came to the second landing where 
 a door UNK-135 a brass plate with the UNK-104 mr . UNK-237 . here he 
 UNK-46 UNK-20 with labour and UNK-764 and UNK-442 . the UNK-367 voice 
 UNK-5 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " come in ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the man entered mr . UNK-304 room . simultaneously mr . UNK-237 a little 
 man wearing UNK-973 glasses on a UNK-59 face shot his head up 
 over a UNK-206 of documents . the head itself was so pink and UNK-801 it 
 seemed like a large egg UNK-732 on the papers . mr . UNK-237 did not lose 
 a moment 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-389 ? what is the meaning of this ? why have i always to UNK-661 
 of you ? may i ask you why you UNK-204 made a copy of that contract 
 between UNK-696 and UNK-546 ? i told you it must be ready by four UNK-270 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but mr . UNK-838 said sir " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " mr . UNK-838 said sir . . . . UNK-320 attend to what i say and not to 
 what mr . UNK-838 says sir . you have always some excuse or another for 
 UNK-152 work . let me tell you that if the contract is not copied before 
 this evening ill lay the matter before mr . UNK-396 . . . . do you hear me 
 now ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes sir . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " do you hear me now ? . . . UNK-42 and another little matter ! i might as well be 
 talking to the wall as talking to you . understand once for all that you 
 get a half an hour for your lunch and not an hour and a half . how many 
 courses do you want id like to know . . . . do you mind me now ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes sir . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-237 bent his head again upon his UNK-206 of papers . the man UNK-156 
 UNK-663 at the polished UNK-241 which directed the affairs of UNK-396 UNK-0 
 UNK-237 UNK-358 its UNK-138 . a UNK-854 of rage UNK-61 his throat for 
 a few moments and then passed leaving after it a sharp UNK-393 of 
 UNK-331 . the man recognised the UNK-393 and felt that he must have a 
 good nights drinking . the middle of the month was passed and if he 
 could get the copy done in time mr . UNK-237 might give him an order on 
 the UNK-367 . he stood still UNK-248 UNK-663 at the head upon the UNK-206 
 of papers . suddenly mr . UNK-237 began to upset all the papers searching 
 for something . then as if he had been UNK-624 of the UNK-54 presence 
 till that moment he shot up his head again saying 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " eh ? are you going to stand there all day ? upon my word UNK-389 you 
 take things easy ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i was waiting to see . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " very good you UNK-449 wait to see . go UNK-627 and do your work . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the man walked heavily towards the door and as he went out of the room 
 he heard mr . UNK-237 cry after him that if the contract was not copied 
 by evening mr . UNK-396 would hear of the matter . 
 UNK-0 
 he returned to his desk in the lower office and counted the sheets which 
 remained to be copied . he took up his pen and UNK-860 it in the ink but 
 he continued to UNK-855 UNK-800 at the last words he had written in no 
 case shall the said bernard UNK-696 be . . . the evening was falling and in 
 a few minutes they would be lighting the gas then he could write . he 
 felt that he must UNK-311 the UNK-331 in his throat . he stood up from his 
 desk and UNK-272 the counter as before passed out of the office . as he 
 was passing out the chief clerk looked at him UNK-985 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " its all right mr . UNK-838 " UNK-0 said the man pointing with his finger to 
 indicate the objective of his journey . 
 UNK-0 
 the chief clerk UNK-75 at the UNK-291 but seeing the row complete 
 offered no remark . as soon as he was on the landing the man pulled 
 a UNK-213 UNK-921 cap out of his pocket put it on his head and ran 
 quickly down the UNK-279 UNK-93 . from the street door he walked on 
 UNK-750 on the inner side of the path towards the corner and all at 
 once UNK-857 into a UNK-102 . he was now safe in the dark UNK-817 of UNK-719 
 shop and filling up the little window that looked into the bar with his 
 UNK-782 face the colour of dark wine or dark meat he called out 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " here pat give us a g UNK-507 . like a good fellow . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-114 brought him a glass of plain porter . the man UNK-59 it at a 
 UNK-161 and asked for a UNK-364 seed . he put his penny on the counter and 
 leaving the UNK-114 to UNK-514 for it in the UNK-286 UNK-486 out of the 
 UNK-817 as UNK-750 as he had entered it . 
 UNK-0 
 darkness accompanied by a thick fog was UNK-779 upon the UNK-322 of 
 february and the lamps in UNK-454 street had been lit . the man went up 
 by the houses until he reached the door of the office wondering whether 
 he could finish his copy in time . on the UNK-93 a UNK-295 UNK-162 UNK-143 of 
 UNK-78 UNK-276 his nose UNK-307 miss UNK-868 had come while he 
 was out in UNK-719 . he UNK-816 his cap back again into his pocket and 
 UNK-128 the office assuming an air of UNK-816 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " mr . UNK-237 has been calling for you " UNK-0 said the chief clerk UNK-952 . 
 UNK-0 " where were you ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the man UNK-75 at the two clients who were standing at the counter as 
 if to intimate that their presence UNK-128 him from answering . as the 
 clients were both male the chief clerk allowed himself a laugh . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i know that game " UNK-0 he said . UNK-0 " five times in one day is a little bit . . . 
 well you better look sharp and get a copy of our correspondence in the 
 UNK-868 case for mr . UNK-237 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 this address in the presence of the public his run UNK-316 and the 
 porter he had UNK-691 down so UNK-542 confused the man and as he sat 
 down at his desk to get what was required he UNK-142 how UNK-172 was 
 the task of finishing his copy of the contract before half past five . 
 the dark UNK-261 night was coming and he UNK-405 to spend it in the bars 
 drinking with his friends UNK-22 the UNK-966 of gas and the UNK-302 of 
 glasses . he got out the UNK-868 correspondence and passed out of 
 the office . he hoped mr . UNK-237 would not discover that the last two 
 letters were missing . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-295 UNK-162 perfume lay all the way up to mr . UNK-304 room . miss 
 UNK-868 was a UNK-190 woman of jewish appearance . mr . UNK-237 was 
 said to be sweet on her or on her money . she came to the office often 
 and stayed a long time when she came . she was sitting beside his desk 
 now in an UNK-493 of UNK-78 UNK-899 the handle of her UNK-148 and 
 UNK-278 the great black UNK-227 in her hat . mr . UNK-237 had UNK-943 
 his chair round to face her and thrown his right foot UNK-315 upon 
 his left knee . the man put the correspondence on the desk and UNK-170 
 UNK-649 but neither mr . UNK-237 nor miss UNK-868 took any notice 
 of his bow . mr . UNK-237 UNK-408 a finger on the correspondence and then 
 UNK-735 it towards him as if to say UNK-0 " thats all right you can go . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the man returned to the lower office and sat down again at his desk . 
 he UNK-156 UNK-978 at the incomplete phrase in no case shall the said 
 bernard UNK-696 be . . . and thought how strange it was that the last three 
 words began with the same letter . the chief clerk began to UNK-282 miss 
 parker saying she would never have the letters UNK-542 in time for post . 
 the man UNK-126 to the clicking of the machine for a few minutes and 
 then set to work to finish his copy . but his head was not clear and his 
 mind UNK-326 away to the UNK-966 and UNK-320 of the UNK-722 . it was a 
 night for hot UNK-852 . he UNK-250 on with his copy but when the clock 
 struck five he had still UNK-450 pages to write . blast it ! he UNK-18 
 finish it in time . he UNK-405 to UNK-650 UNK-736 to bring his fist down 
 on something UNK-611 . he was so UNK-571 that he wrote bernard bernard 
 instead of bernard UNK-696 and had to begin again on a clean sheet . 
 UNK-0 
 he felt strong enough to clear out the whole office UNK-395 . his 
 body UNK-183 to do something to rush out and UNK-994 in violence . all 
 the UNK-967 of his life UNK-571 him . . . . could he ask the UNK-367 
 UNK-161 for an advance ? no the UNK-367 was no good no damn good 
 he UNK-9 give an advance . . . . he knew where he would meet the boys 
 leonard and UNK-93 and UNK-157 UNK-86 . the UNK-716 of his emotional 
 nature was set for a spell of UNK-306 . 
 UNK-0 
 his imagination had so UNK-141 him that his name was called twice 
 before he answered . mr . UNK-237 and miss UNK-868 were standing outside 
 the counter and all the UNK-653 had turn round in UNK-591 of 
 something . the man got up from his desk . mr . UNK-237 began a UNK-555 of 
 abuse saying that two letters were missing . the man answered that he 
 knew nothing about them that he had made a UNK-620 copy . the UNK-555 
 continued it was so UNK-412 and violent that the man could hardly 
 UNK-561 his fist from descending upon the head of the UNK-919 before 
 him . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i know nothing about any other two letters " UNK-0 he said UNK-800 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-491 . of course you know nothing " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-237 . 
 UNK-0 " tell me " UNK-0 he added UNK-220 first for approval to the lady beside him 
 UNK-0 " do you take me for a fool ? do you think me an UNK-916 fool ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the man UNK-75 from the UNK-532 face to the little UNK-448 head and 
 back again and almost before he was aware of it his tongue had found 
 a UNK-324 moment 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i dont think sir " UNK-0 he said UNK-0 " that thats a fair question to put to 
 me . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 there was a UNK-242 in the very breathing of the UNK-653 . everyone was 
 UNK-22 the author of the UNK-991 no less than his UNK-611 and 
 miss UNK-868 who was a UNK-98 UNK-677 person began to smile UNK-839 . 
 mr . UNK-237 UNK-327 to the UNK-641 of a wild rose and his mouth UNK-91 
 with a UNK-74 passion . he UNK-35 his fist in the UNK-54 face till it 
 seemed to UNK-411 like the UNK-269 of some electric machine 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " you UNK-826 UNK-17 ! you UNK-826 UNK-17 ! ill make short work 
 of you ! wait till you see ! UNK-85 UNK-732 to me for your UNK-390 
 or UNK-85 quit the office UNK-351 ! UNK-85 quit this im telling you 
 or UNK-85 UNK-732 to me ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he stood in a UNK-102 opposite the office watching to see if the UNK-367 
 would come out alone . all the UNK-653 passed out and finally the UNK-367 
 came out with the chief clerk . it was no use trying to say a word to him 
 when he was with the chief clerk . the man felt that his position was bad 
 enough . he had been UNK-499 to offer an UNK-404 UNK-679 to mr . UNK-237 
 for his UNK-390 but he knew what a UNK-648 nest the office would 
 be for him . he could remember the way in which mr . UNK-237 had UNK-573 
 little UNK-205 out of the office in order to make room for his own UNK-401 . 
 he felt savage and UNK-403 and UNK-142 UNK-776 with himself and with 
 everyone else . mr . UNK-237 would never give him an hours rest his life 
 would be a hell to him . he had made a proper fool of himself this time . 
 could he not keep his tongue in his UNK-139 ? but they had never pulled 
 together from the first he and mr . UNK-237 ever since the day mr . 
 UNK-237 had UNK-196 him UNK-841 his north of ireland accent to UNK-317 
 UNK-565 and miss parker that had been the beginning of it . he might 
 have tried UNK-565 for the money but sure UNK-565 never had anything 
 for himself . a man with two UNK-604 to keep up of course he 
 UNK-18 . . . . 
 UNK-0 
 he felt his great body again UNK-620 for the comfort of the UNK-722 . 
 the fog had begun to UNK-915 him and he UNK-105 could he touch pat in 
 UNK-719 . he could not touch him for more than a UNK-131 a bob was 
 no use . yet he must get money somewhere or other he had spent his 
 last penny for the g UNK-507 . and soon it would be too late for getting money 
 anywhere . suddenly as he was fingering his UNK-933 he thought of 
 terry UNK-331 UNK-318 in fleet street . that was the UNK-825 ! why UNK-3 
 he think of it UNK-973 ? 
 UNK-0 
 he went through the narrow UNK-270 of temple bar quickly UNK-794 to 
 himself that they could all go to hell because he was going to have 
 a good night of it . the clerk in terry UNK-331 said a crown ! but the 
 UNK-814 held out for six UNK-51 and in the end the six UNK-51 
 was allowed him literally . he came out of the UNK-318 UNK-28 
 making a little cylinder of the coins between his thumb and fingers . in 
 UNK-900 street the UNK-119 were UNK-196 with young men and women 
 returning from business and UNK-884 UNK-615 ran here and there UNK-526 
 out the names of the evening editions . the man passed through the crowd 
 looking on the UNK-876 generally with proud satisfaction and UNK-151 
 UNK-90 at the UNK-993 . his head was full of the UNK-304 of 
 UNK-425 and UNK-730 UNK-428 and his nose already UNK-47 the 
 UNK-556 UNK-96 of punch . as he walked on he UNK-70 the terms in which 
 he would UNK-911 the incident to the boys 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " so i just looked at UNK-330 you know and looked at her . then i 
 looked back at him UNK-153 my time you know . i dont think that 
 thats a fair question to put to me says i . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-157 UNK-86 was sitting up in his usual corner of UNK-188 UNK-24 and when 
 he heard the story he stood UNK-389 a UNK-984 saying it was as 
 smart a thing as ever he heard . UNK-389 stood a drink in his turn . 
 after a while UNK-93 and UNK-65 leonard came in and the story was 
 repeated to them . UNK-93 stood UNK-983 of UNK-119 hot all round and 
 told the story of the UNK-790 he had made to the chief clerk when he was 
 in UNK-81 of UNK-68 street but as the UNK-790 was after the manner 
 of the liberal UNK-213 in the UNK-660 he had to admit that it was 
 not as UNK-324 as UNK-377 UNK-790 . at this UNK-389 told the boys 
 to polish off that and have another . 
 UNK-0 
 just as they were UNK-972 their UNK-468 who should come in but UNK-565 ! 
 of course he had to join in with the others . the men asked him to give 
 his version of it and he did so with great UNK-315 for the sight of 
 five small hot UNK-34 was very UNK-398 . everyone UNK-172 
 laughing when he showed the way in which mr . UNK-237 UNK-35 his fist in 
 UNK-377 face . then he UNK-646 UNK-389 saying UNK-0 " and here was my 
 UNK-593 as cool as you please " UNK-0 while UNK-389 looked at the company out 
 of his heavy dirty eyes UNK-21 and at times drawing forth UNK-987 drops 
 of UNK-246 from his UNK-91 with the aid of his lower lip . 
 UNK-0 
 when that round was over there was a UNK-242 . UNK-93 had money but 
 neither of the other two seemed to have any so the whole party left 
 the shop somewhat UNK-729 . at the corner of duke street UNK-565 and 
 UNK-157 UNK-86 UNK-45 off to the left while the other three turned back 
 towards the city . rain was UNK-289 down on the cold streets and when 
 they reached the UNK-971 office UNK-389 suggested the UNK-739 house . 
 the bar was full of men and loud with the noise of UNK-591 and glasses . 
 the three men pushed past the UNK-846 UNK-26 at the door and 
 formed a little party at the corner of the counter . they began to 
 exchange stories . leonard introduced them to a young fellow named 
 UNK-730 who was performing at the UNK-68 as an acrobat and UNK-335 
 UNK-612 . UNK-389 stood a drink all round . UNK-730 said he would take 
 a small irish and UNK-177 . UNK-389 who had UNK-861 UNK-697 of 
 what was what asked the boys would they have an UNK-177 too 
 but the boys told tim to make UNK-75 hot . the talk became UNK-217 . 
 UNK-93 stood a round and then UNK-389 stood another round 
 UNK-730 UNK-975 that the hospitality was too irish . he promised to 
 get them in behind the scenes and introduce them to some nice girls . 
 UNK-93 said that he and leonard would go but that UNK-389 
 UNK-9 go because he was a married man and UNK-377 heavy dirty 
 eyes UNK-375 at the company in token that he understood he was being 
 UNK-777 . UNK-730 made them all have just one little UNK-285 at his 
 expense and promised to meet them later on at UNK-653 in UNK-499 
 street . 
 UNK-0 
 when the UNK-739 house closed they went round to UNK-653 . they went 
 into the UNK-309 at the back and UNK-93 ordered small hot specials 
 all round . they were all beginning to feel UNK-154 . UNK-389 was just 
 standing another round when UNK-730 came back . much to UNK-377 
 relief he UNK-59 a glass of UNK-412 this time . funds were getting low but 
 they had enough to keep them going . presently two young women with big 
 hats and a young man in a check suit came in and sat at a table close 
 by . UNK-730 UNK-276 them and told the company that they were out of the 
 UNK-68 . UNK-377 eyes UNK-326 at every moment in the direction of 
 one of the young women . there was something striking in her appearance . 
 an UNK-557 UNK-700 of UNK-173 UNK-769 was wound round her hat and 
 UNK-253 in a great bow under her UNK-333 and she UNK-71 bright yellow 
 gloves reaching to the UNK-213 . UNK-389 UNK-84 UNK-237 at the UNK-191 
 arm which she moved very often and with much grace and when after a 
 little time she answered his UNK-49 he UNK-336 still more her large dark 
 brown eyes . the UNK-371 UNK-151 expression in them UNK-160 him . she 
 UNK-75 at him once or twice and when the party was leaving the room 
 she UNK-30 against his chair and said UNK-0 " o UNK-906 ! " UNK-0 in a london accent . 
 he watched her leave the room in the hope that she would look back at 
 him but he was disappointed . he UNK-657 his want of money and UNK-657 all 
 the rounds he had stood particularly all the UNK-34 and UNK-665 
 which he had stood to UNK-730 . if there was one thing that he UNK-956 it 
 was a UNK-231 . he was so angry that he lost count of the conversation of 
 his friends . 
 UNK-0 
 when UNK-65 leonard called him he found that they were talking about 
 UNK-963 of strength . UNK-730 was showing his UNK-316 muscle to the company 
 and UNK-478 so much that the other two had called on UNK-389 to 
 UNK-61 the national UNK-88 . UNK-389 pulled up his sleeve accordingly 
 and showed his UNK-316 muscle to the company . the two arms were examined 
 and compared and finally it was agreed to have a trial of strength . the 
 table was cleared and the two men UNK-346 their UNK-122 on it UNK-621 
 hands . when UNK-65 leonard said UNK-0 " go ! " UNK-0 each was to try to bring down 
 the others hand on to the table . UNK-389 looked very serious and 
 determined . 
 UNK-0 
 the trial began . after about thirty seconds UNK-730 brought his 
 opponents hand slowly down on to the table . UNK-377 dark 
 UNK-496 face UNK-327 UNK-13 still with anger and UNK-396 at 
 having been UNK-229 by such a UNK-743 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-14 not to put the weight of your body behind it . play fair " UNK-0 he 
 said . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-169 not playing fair ? " UNK-0 said the other . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " come on again . the two best out of three . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the trial began again . the UNK-692 stood out on UNK-377 UNK-133 
 and the UNK-917 of UNK-730 UNK-691 changed to UNK-831 . their hands 
 and arms UNK-515 under the stress . after a long struggle UNK-730 again 
 brought his opponents hand slowly on to the table . there was a UNK-208 
 of UNK-541 from the UNK-9 . the UNK-114 who was standing beside 
 the table UNK-146 his red head towards the victor and said with stupid 
 UNK-282 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ah ! thats the UNK-943 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what the hell do you know about it ? " UNK-0 said UNK-389 UNK-809 turning 
 on the man . UNK-0 " what do you put in your UNK-546 for ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " sh sh ! " UNK-0 said UNK-93 UNK-532 the violent expression of 
 UNK-377 face . UNK-0 " UNK-923 up boys . well have just one little UNK-136 
 more and then well be off . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 a very UNK-939 man stood at the corner of UNK-310 bridge 
 waiting for the little UNK-476 UNK-80 to take him home . he was full 
 of UNK-120 anger and UNK-476 . he felt UNK-8 and 
 UNK-562 he did not even feel drunk and he had only UNK-770 in 
 his pocket . he UNK-657 everything . he had done for himself in the office 
 UNK-173 his watch spent all his money and he had not even got drunk . 
 he began to feel UNK-403 again and he UNK-405 to be back again in the hot 
 UNK-374 UNK-722 . he had lost his reputation as a strong man having 
 been UNK-229 twice by a mere boy . his heart UNK-641 with UNK-558 and when 
 he thought of the woman in the big hat who had UNK-30 against him and 
 said UNK-906 ! his UNK-558 nearly UNK-293 him . 
 UNK-0 
 his UNK-80 let him down at UNK-759 road and he UNK-392 his great body 
 along in the shadow of the wall of the UNK-436 . he UNK-870 returning 
 to his home . when he went in by the UNK-3 he found the kitchen empty 
 and the kitchen fire nearly out . he UNK-38 UNK-316 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ada ! ada ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 his wife was a little UNK-177 woman who UNK-232 her husband when 
 he was UNK-357 and was UNK-232 by him when he was drunk . they had five 
 children . a little boy came running down the UNK-93 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " who is that ? " UNK-0 said the man UNK-639 through the darkness . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " me pa . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " who are you ? charlie ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no pa . tom . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-189 your mother ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-23 out at the chapel . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " thats right . . . . did she think of leaving any dinner for me ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes pa . i " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " light the lamp . what do you mean by having the place in darkness ? are 
 the other children in bed ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the man sat down heavily on one of the chairs while the little boy 
 lit the lamp . he began to UNK-22 his sons flat accent saying half to 
 himself UNK-0 " at the chapel . at the chapel if you please ! " UNK-0 when the lamp 
 was lit he UNK-794 his fist on the table and UNK-247 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " whats for my dinner ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " im going . . . to cook it pa " UNK-0 said the little boy . 
 UNK-0 
 the man UNK-615 up UNK-869 and pointed to the fire . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " on that fire ! you let the fire out ! by god ill teach you to do that 
 again ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he took a step to the door and UNK-457 the UNK-406 which was 
 standing behind it . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ill teach you to let the fire out ! " UNK-0 he said rolling up his sleeve in 
 order to give his arm free play . 
 UNK-0 
 the little boy UNK-5 UNK-0 " o pa ! " UNK-0 and ran UNK-613 round the table but 
 the man followed him and caught him by the coat . the little boy looked 
 about him UNK-659 but seeing no way of escape fell upon his UNK-111 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " now UNK-85 let the fire out the next time ! " UNK-0 said the man striking at 
 him UNK-428 with the stick . UNK-0 " take that you little UNK-610 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the boy UNK-420 a UNK-143 of pain as the stick cut his UNK-606 . he UNK-669 
 his hands together in the air and his voice UNK-35 with UNK-512 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o pa ! " UNK-0 he UNK-5 . UNK-0 " dont beat me pa ! and ill . . . ill say a UNK-732 mary

 the UNK-645 had given her leave to go out as soon as the womens tea was 
 over and maria looked forward to her evening out . the kitchen was 
 UNK-831 and span the cook said you could see yourself in the big copper 
 UNK-891 . the fire was nice and bright and on one of the UNK-218 were 
 four very big UNK-909 . these UNK-909 seemed UNK-654 but if you went 
 closer you would see that they had been cut into long thick even UNK-174 
 and were ready to be handed round at tea . maria had cut them herself . 
 UNK-0 
 maria was a very very small person indeed but she had a very long 
 nose and a very long UNK-333 . she talked a little through her nose always 
 UNK-214 UNK-0 " yes my dear " UNK-0 and UNK-0 " no my dear . " UNK-0 she was always sent for 
 when the women UNK-52 over their UNK-812 and always UNK-427 in making 
 peace . one day the UNK-645 had said to her 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " maria you are a UNK-200 UNK-229 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 and the UNK-487 and two of the board ladies had heard the UNK-805 . 
 and UNK-534 UNK-381 was always saying what she UNK-9 do to the UNK-891 
 who had charge of the UNK-860 if it UNK-69 for maria . everyone was so UNK-345 
 of maria . 
 UNK-0 
 the women would have their tea at six UNK-270 and she would be able to 
 get away before seven . from UNK-422 to the UNK-271 twenty minutes 
 from the UNK-271 to UNK-146 twenty minutes and twenty minutes to buy 
 the things . she would be there before eight . she took out her purse with 
 the silver UNK-943 and read again the words a present from belfast . she 
 was very UNK-345 of that purse because joe had brought it to her five years 
 before when he and UNK-83 had gone to belfast on a UNK-750 trip . in 
 the purse were two UNK-924 and some UNK-526 . she would have five 
 UNK-51 clear after paying UNK-80 fare . what a nice evening they would 
 have all the children singing ! only she hoped that joe UNK-9 come in 
 drunk . he was so different when he took any drink . 
 UNK-0 
 often he had wanted her to go and live with them but she would have 
 felt herself in the way though UNK-978 wife was ever so nice with her 
 and she had become UNK-354 to the life of the laundry . joe was a good 
 fellow . she had UNK-853 him and UNK-83 too and joe used often say 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-883 is UNK-883 but maria is my proper mother . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 after the UNK-364 at home the boys had got her that position in the 
 dublin by UNK-963 laundry and she liked it . she used to have such 
 a bad opinion of UNK-949 but now she thought they were very nice 
 people a little quiet and serious but still very nice people to live 
 with . then she had her plants in the UNK-729 and she liked looking 
 after them . she had lovely UNK-966 and UNK-703 and whenever anyone 
 came to visit her she always gave the visitor one or two UNK-750 from 
 her UNK-729 . there was one thing she UNK-3 like and that was the 
 UNK-19 on the walks but the UNK-645 was such a nice person to deal with 
 so UNK-805 . 
 UNK-0 
 when the cook told her everything was ready she went into the womens 
 room and began to pull the big bell . in a few minutes the women began 
 to come in by UNK-473 and UNK-995 UNK-859 their UNK-467 hands in their 
 UNK-966 and pulling down the UNK-552 of their UNK-32 over their red 
 UNK-467 arms . they settled down before their huge UNK-903 which the cook 
 and the UNK-891 filled up with hot tea already mixed with milk and sugar 
 in huge tin UNK-541 . maria UNK-718 the distribution of the UNK-287 
 and saw that every woman got her four UNK-174 . there was a great deal of 
 laughing and UNK-434 during the meal . UNK-356 UNK-132 said maria was sure 
 to get the ring and though UNK-132 had said that for so many UNK-942 
 UNK-386 maria had to laugh and say she UNK-3 want any ring or man either 
 and when she UNK-20 her UNK-174 eyes UNK-107 with disappointed 
 UNK-787 and the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her UNK-333 . then 
 UNK-534 UNK-381 UNK-64 her mug of tea and proposed UNK-669 health while 
 all the other women UNK-34 with their UNK-903 on the table and said she 
 was sorry she UNK-180 a UNK-137 of porter to drink it in . and maria UNK-20 
 again till the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her UNK-333 and till 
 her minute body nearly UNK-35 itself UNK-742 because she knew that UNK-381 
 meant well though of course she had the UNK-697 of a common woman . 
 UNK-0 
 but UNK-69 maria glad when the women had finished their tea and the cook 
 and the UNK-891 had begun to clear away the UNK-6 ! she went into 
 her little bedroom and UNK-617 that the next morning was a mass 
 morning changed the hand of the alarm from seven to six . then she took 
 off her working skirt and her UNK-188 and laid her best skirt out on 
 the bed and her tiny UNK-616 beside the foot of the bed . she changed 
 her UNK-413 too and as she stood before the mirror she thought of how 
 she used to dress for mass on sunday morning when she was a young girl 
 and she looked with UNK-495 UNK-874 at the UNK-156 body which she 
 had so often UNK-463 . in UNK-300 of its years she found it a nice UNK-517 
 little body . 
 UNK-0 
 when she got outside the streets were UNK-160 with rain and she was glad 
 of her old brown waterproof . the UNK-80 was full and she had to sit on the 
 little UNK-518 at the end of the car facing all the people with her UNK-297 
 barely UNK-358 the floor . she arranged in her mind all she was going to 
 do and thought how much better it was to be independent and to have your 
 own money in your pocket . she hoped they would have a nice evening . she 
 was sure they would but she could not help thinking what a UNK-47 it was 
 UNK-83 and joe were not speaking . they were always falling out now but 
 when they were boys together they used to be the best of friends but 
 such was life . 
 UNK-0 
 she got out of her UNK-80 at the UNK-271 and UNK-111 her way quickly among 
 the UNK-291 . she went into UNK-798 UNK-870 but the shop was so full of 
 people that it was a long time before she could get herself attended 
 to . she bought a dozen of mixed penny cakes and at last came out of the 
 shop laden with a big bag . then she thought what else would she buy she 
 wanted to buy something really nice . they would be sure to have plenty 
 of UNK-607 and nuts . it was hard to know what to buy and all she could 
 think of was cake . she decided to buy some UNK-325 but UNK-798 
 UNK-325 had not enough UNK-130 UNK-6 on top of it so she went over to 
 a shop in henry street . here she was a long time in UNK-452 herself and 
 the stylish young lady behind the counter who was UNK-307 a little 
 UNK-776 by her asked her was it UNK-308 she wanted to buy . that 
 made maria UNK-801 and smile at the young lady but the young lady took it 
 all very seriously and finally cut a thick UNK-676 of UNK-325 UNK-331 
 it up and said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-222 please . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she thought she would have to stand in the UNK-146 UNK-80 because none 
 of the young men seemed to notice her but an elderly gentleman made room 
 for her . he was a UNK-98 gentleman and he UNK-71 a brown hard hat he had 
 a square red face and a UNK-22 UNK-91 . maria thought he was a 
 UNK-498 gentleman and she reflected how much more UNK-727 he was 
 than the young men who simply UNK-156 straight before them . the gentleman 
 began to chat with her about UNK-942 eve and the UNK-726 weather . he 
 supposed the bag was full of good things for the little ones and said 
 it was only right that the UNK-387 should enjoy themselves while they 
 were young . maria agreed with him and UNK-992 him with UNK-139 UNK-196 and 
 UNK-650 . he was very nice with her and when she was getting out at the 
 canal bridge she UNK-433 him and UNK-170 and he UNK-170 to her and raised 
 his hat and UNK-24 UNK-335 and while she was going up along the 
 terrace UNK-277 her tiny head under the rain she thought how easy it 
 was to know a gentleman even when he has a drop taken . 
 UNK-0 
 everybody said UNK-0 " o UNK-182 maria ! " UNK-0 when she came to UNK-978 house . joe was 
 there having come home from business and all the children had their 
 sunday dresses on . there were two big girls in from next door and games 
 were going on . maria gave the bag of cakes to the UNK-904 boy UNK-83 to 
 divide and mrs . UNK-958 said it was too good of her to bring such a big 
 bag of cakes and made all the children say 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " thanks maria . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 but maria said she had brought something special for UNK-758 and UNK-883 
 something they would be sure to like and she began to look for her 
 UNK-325 . she tried in UNK-798 bag and then in the pockets of her 
 waterproof and then on the UNK-565 but nowhere could she find it . 
 then she asked all the children had any of them UNK-361 UNK-545 mistake of 
 UNK-334 the children all said no and looked as if they did not like 
 to eat cakes if they were to be accused of UNK-511 . everybody had a 
 solution for the mystery and mrs . UNK-958 said it was plain that maria 
 had left it behind her in the UNK-80 . maria UNK-617 how confused the 
 gentleman with the UNK-22 UNK-91 had made her UNK-332 with shame 
 and UNK-764 and UNK-965 . at the thought of the failure of her 
 little surprise and of the two and UNK-511 she had thrown away for 
 nothing she nearly UNK-5 UNK-366 . 
 UNK-0 
 but joe said it UNK-3 matter and made her sit down by the fire . he 
 was very nice with her . he told her all that went on in his office 
 UNK-598 for her a smart answer which he had made to the manager . maria 
 did not understand why joe UNK-20 so much over the answer he had made 
 but she said that the manager must have been a very UNK-38 person 
 to deal with . joe said he UNK-69 so bad when you knew how to take him 
 that he was a decent sort so long as you UNK-3 UNK-936 him the wrong way . 
 mrs . UNK-958 played the piano for the children and they UNK-452 and 
 UNK-57 . then the two UNK-178 girls handed round the nuts . nobody could 
 find the UNK-601 and joe was nearly getting cross over it and asked 
 how did they expect maria to crack nuts without a UNK-762 . but maria 
 said she UNK-3 like nuts and that they UNK-265 to bother about her . 
 then joe asked would she take a bottle of UNK-98 and mrs . UNK-958 said 
 there was port wine too in the house if she would prefer that . maria 
 said she would rather they UNK-3 ask her to take anything but joe 
 UNK-100 . 
 UNK-0 
 so maria let him have his way and they sat by the fire talking over old 
 times and maria thought she would put in a good word for UNK-83 . but joe 
 UNK-5 that god might strike him stone dead if ever he spoke a word to 
 his brother again and maria said she was sorry she had mentioned the 
 matter . mrs . UNK-958 told her husband it was a great shame for him to 
 speak that way of his own flesh and blood but joe said that UNK-83 was no 
 brother of his and there was nearly being a row on the head of it . but 
 joe said he would not lose his UNK-933 on account of the night it was 
 and asked his wife to open some more UNK-98 . the two UNK-178 girls 
 had arranged some UNK-942 eve games and soon everything was merry again . 
 maria was UNK-649 to see the children so merry and joe and his wife in 
 such good spirits . the UNK-178 girls put some UNK-4 on the table 
 and then led the children up to the table UNK-178 . one got the 
 UNK-76 and the other three got the water and when one of the 
 UNK-178 girls got the ring mrs . UNK-958 UNK-35 her finger at the 
 UNK-521 girl as much as to say o i know all about it ! they UNK-100 
 then on UNK-514 maria and leading her up to the table to see 
 what she would get and while they were putting on the UNK-570 maria 
 UNK-20 and UNK-20 again till the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of 
 her UNK-333 . 
 UNK-0 
 they led her up to the table UNK-22 laughing and UNK-434 and she put her 
 hand out in the air as she was told to do . she moved her hand about here 
 and there in the air and UNK-244 on one of the UNK-4 . she felt a 
 soft wet substance with her fingers and was surprised that nobody spoke 
 or took off her UNK-570 . there was a UNK-242 for a few seconds and then 
 a great deal of UNK-683 and UNK-387 . somebody said something about 
 the garden and at last mrs . UNK-958 said something very cross to one 
 of the UNK-178 girls and told her to throw it out at once that was no 
 play . maria understood that it was wrong that time and so she had to do 
 it over again and this time she got the UNK-76 . 
 UNK-0 
 after that mrs . UNK-958 played miss UNK-479 reel for the children 
 and joe made maria take a glass of wine . soon they were all quite merry 
 again and mrs . UNK-958 said maria would enter a UNK-575 before the year 
 was out because she had got the UNK-76 . maria had never seen joe 
 so nice to her as he was that night so full of pleasant talk and 
 UNK-158 . she said they were all very good to her . 
 UNK-0 
 at last the children grew tired and UNK-638 and joe asked maria would she 
 not sing some little song before she went one of the old songs . mrs . 
 UNK-958 said UNK-0 " do please maria ! " UNK-0 and so maria had to get up and stand 
 beside the piano . mrs . UNK-958 UNK-432 the children be quiet and listen 
 to UNK-669 song . then she played the UNK-264 and said UNK-0 " now maria ! " UNK-0 and 
 maria UNK-521 very much began to sing in a tiny UNK-681 voice . she 
 UNK-57 i UNK-459 that i UNK-210 and when she came to the second verse she 
 UNK-57 again 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  i UNK-459 that i UNK-210 in marble UNK-80 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  with UNK-260 and UNK-810 at my side 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  and of all who assembled within those walls 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  that i was the hope and the pride . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  i had UNK-281 too great to count could UNK-118 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  of a high UNK-791 name 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  but i also UNK-459 which pleased me most 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0  that you loved me still the same . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 but no one tried to show her her mistake and when she had ended her 
 song joe was very much moved . he said that there was no time like the 
 long ago and no music for him like poor old UNK-26 whatever other people 
 might say and his eyes filled up so much with tears that he could not 
 find what he was looking for and in the end he had to ask his wife to 
 tell him where the UNK-257 was . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 a painful case 
 UNK-0 
 mr . james UNK-355 lived in UNK-889 because he UNK-136 to live as far as 
 possible from the city of which he was a citizen and because he found 
 all the other UNK-501 of dublin mean modern and UNK-295 . he lived 
 in an old UNK-967 house and from his windows he could look into the 
 UNK-647 UNK-86 or UNK-356 along the UNK-502 river on which dublin is 
 built . the UNK-173 walls of his UNK-448 room were free from pictures . 
 he had himself bought every article of furniture in the room a black 
 iron UNK-230 an iron UNK-109 four UNK-330 chairs a UNK-979 
 a UNK-906 a UNK-153 and UNK-860 and a square table on which lay a 
 double desk . a UNK-434 had been made in an UNK-740 by means of UNK-891 
 of white wood . the bed was UNK-389 with white UNK-562 and a black 
 and UNK-205 rug covered the foot . a little UNK-746 hung above the 
 UNK-109 and during the day a UNK-923 lamp stood as the sole 
 UNK-677 of the UNK-425 . the books on the white wooden UNK-891 were 
 arranged from below UNK-356 according to bulk . a complete UNK-98 
 stood at one end of the lowest shelf and a copy of the UNK-224 
 UNK-694 UNK-400 into the cloth cover of a notebook stood at one end of 
 the top shelf . writing materials were always on the desk . in the desk 
 lay a UNK-627 translation of UNK-494 michael UNK-272 the stage 
 directions of which were written in purple ink and a little UNK-848 of 
 papers held together by a brass pin . in these sheets a sentence was 
 UNK-882 from time to time and in an UNK-621 moment the headline of 
 an advertisement for UNK-732 beans had been UNK-339 on to the first sheet . 
 on UNK-272 the lid of the desk a UNK-90 fragrance UNK-424 fragrance 
 of new UNK-306 UNK-786 or of a bottle of UNK-211 or of an UNK-454 apple 
 which might have been left there and forgotten . 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-355 UNK-867 anything which UNK-986 physical or mental disorder . 
 a UNK-826 doctor would have called him UNK-315 . his face which 
 carried the entire tale of his years was of the brown UNK-151 of dublin 
 streets . on his long and rather large head grew dry black hair and a 
 UNK-950 UNK-91 did not quite cover an UNK-534 mouth . his UNK-508 
 also gave his face a UNK-142 character but there was no UNK-146 in the 
 eyes which looking at the world from under their UNK-950 UNK-993 gave 
 the impression of a man ever alert to UNK-366 a UNK-151 UNK-375 in 
 others but often disappointed . he lived at a little distance from his 
 body regarding his own acts with UNK-482 UNK-586 . he had an odd 
 UNK-686 UNK-158 which led him to UNK-546 in his mind from time 
 to time a short sentence about himself containing a subject in the third 
 person and a UNK-994 in the past UNK-134 . he never gave UNK-265 to UNK-228 
 and walked UNK-419 carrying a UNK-98 UNK-164 . 
 UNK-0 
 he had been for many years UNK-367 of a private bank in UNK-438 street . 
 every morning he came in from UNK-889 by UNK-80 . at UNK-459 he went 
 to dan UNK-222 and took his UNK-380 bottle of UNK-708 beer and a small 
 UNK-510 of UNK-858 UNK-140 . at four UNK-270 he was set free . he UNK-618 
 in an UNK-393 in UNK-528 street where he felt himself safe from 
 the society of UNK-630 UNK-150 youth and where there was a certain plain 
 UNK-909 in the bill of fare . his UNK-648 were spent either before his 
 UNK-446 piano or UNK-765 about the UNK-316 of the city . his UNK-393 
 for UNK-225 music brought him sometimes to an opera or a concert these 
 were the only UNK-738 of his life . 
 UNK-0 
 he had neither UNK-193 nor friends church nor UNK-520 . he lived his 
 spiritual life without any UNK-415 with others visiting his relatives 
 at christmas and UNK-184 them to the cemetery when they died . he 
 performed these two social duties for old UNK-441 sake but UNK-111 
 nothing further to the conventions which UNK-161 the civic life . he 
 allowed himself to think that in certain circumstances he would rob 
 his UNK-429 but as these circumstances never UNK-507 his life rolled out 
 UNK-764 UNK-134 tale . 
 UNK-0 
 one evening he found himself sitting beside two ladies in the UNK-888 . 
 the house UNK-141 UNK-572 and silent gave UNK-394 UNK-195 of 
 failure . the lady who sat next him looked round at the UNK-761 house 
 once or twice and then said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what a UNK-47 there is such a poor house tonight ! its so hard on people 
 to have to sing to empty UNK-674 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he took the remark as an invitation to talk . he was surprised that 
 she seemed so little UNK-795 . while they talked he tried to fix her 
 UNK-603 in his memory . when he learned that the young girl beside 
 her was her daughter he UNK-863 her to be a year or so younger than 
 himself . her face which must have been UNK-218 had remained 
 intelligent . it was an oval face with strongly marked features . the eyes 
 were very dark blue and steady . their UNK-49 began with a UNK-359 note 
 but was confused by what seemed a UNK-781 UNK-318 of the UNK-846 into the 
 UNK-272 UNK-410 for an instant a UNK-910 of great UNK-720 . the 
 UNK-846 UNK-327 itself quickly this UNK-500 nature fell again 
 under the UNK-276 of UNK-861 and her UNK-406 jacket UNK-916 a UNK-186 
 of a certain UNK-252 struck the note of UNK-529 more definitely . 
 UNK-0 
 he met her again a few weeks afterwards at a concert in UNK-294 
 terrace and UNK-457 the moments when her daughters attention was 
 UNK-917 to become intimate . she UNK-597 once or twice to her husband 
 but her tone was not such as to make the UNK-858 a warning . her name 
 was mrs . UNK-982 . her UNK-624 UNK-747 had come from 
 UNK-149 . her husband was captain of a UNK-93 boat UNK-171 between 
 dublin and holland and they had one child . 
 UNK-0 
 meeting her a third time by accident he found courage to make an 
 appointment . she came . this was the first of many meetings they met 
 always in the evening and chose the most quiet quarters for their walks 
 together . mr . UNK-355 however had a UNK-11 for UNK-218 ways and 
 finding that they were UNK-611 to meet UNK-55 he forced her to 
 ask him to her house . captain UNK-982 encouraged his visits thinking 
 that his daughters hand was in question . he had UNK-739 his wife so 
 UNK-807 from his gallery of UNK-744 that he did not suspect that 
 anyone else would take an interest in her . as the husband was often 
 away and the daughter out giving music lessons mr . UNK-355 had many 
 opportunities of enjoying the UNK-532 society . neither he nor she had had 
 any such adventure before and neither was conscious of any UNK-875 . 
 little by little he UNK-799 his thoughts with UNK-349 . he UNK-256 her books 
 provided her with ideas shared his intellectual life with her . she 
 UNK-126 to all . 
 UNK-0 
 sometimes in return for his theories she gave out some fact of her own 
 life . with almost UNK-562 UNK-890 she UNK-318 him to let his nature 
 open to the full she became his UNK-708 . he told her that for some 
 time he had assisted at the meetings of an irish UNK-372 party where 
 he had felt himself a unique figure UNK-17 a score of UNK-357 UNK-166 in 
 a UNK-731 lit by an UNK-960 UNK-415 . when the party had divided into 
 three sections each under its own leader and in its own UNK-731 he had 
 UNK-815 his UNK-801 . the UNK-463 discussions he said 
 were too UNK-901 the interest they took in the question of wages was 
 UNK-816 . he felt that they were UNK-796 UNK-549 and that they 
 UNK-77 an UNK-749 which was the produce of a leisure not within 
 their reach . no social revolution he told her would be likely to 
 strike dublin for some centuries . 
 UNK-0 
 she asked him why did he not write out his thoughts . for what he asked 
 her with careful UNK-589 . to compete with UNK-676 UNK-126 of 
 thinking UNK-865 for UNK-467 seconds ? to submit himself to the 
 UNK-553 of an UNK-376 middle class which UNK-541 its UNK-83 to 
 UNK-695 and its fine arts to UNK-311 ? 
 UNK-0 
 he went often to her little cottage outside dublin often they spent 
 their UNK-648 alone . little by little as their thoughts UNK-799 
 they spoke of subjects less remote . her UNK-678 was like a warm 
 soil about an exotic . many times she allowed the dark to fall upon 
 them UNK-134 from lighting the lamp . the dark UNK-317 room their 
 isolation the music that still UNK-40 in their ears united them . 
 this union UNK-198 him UNK-71 away the rough edges of his character 
 UNK-713 his mental life . sometimes he caught himself listening to 
 the sound of his own voice . he thought that in her eyes he would UNK-770 
 to an UNK-204 UNK-837 and as he attached the UNK-479 nature of his 
 companion more and more closely to him he heard the strange UNK-886 
 voice which he recognised as his own UNK-954 on the souls UNK-711 
 UNK-964 . we UNK-216 give ourselves it said we are our own . the end 
 of these UNK-127 was that one night during which she had shown every 
 sign of unusual excitement mrs . UNK-982 caught up his hand UNK-311 
 and pressed it to her UNK-139 . 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-355 was very much surprised . her interpretation of his words 
 UNK-219 him . he did not visit her for a week then he wrote to her 
 asking her to meet him . as he did not wish their last interview to be 
 UNK-371 by the influence of their UNK-21 UNK-948 they met in a 
 little UNK-870 near the UNK-4 . it was cold autumn weather but in 
 UNK-300 of the cold they UNK-326 up and down the roads of the park for 
 nearly three hours . they agreed to break off their UNK-299 every 
 bond he said is a bond to UNK-234 . when they came out of the park they 
 walked in silence towards the UNK-80 but here she began to UNK-498 
 so UNK-611 that UNK-143 another collapse on her part he UNK-432 her 
 UNK-244 quickly and left her . a few days later he received a parcel 
 containing his books and music . 
 UNK-0 
 four years passed . mr . UNK-355 returned to his even way of life . his room 
 still UNK-135 witness of the UNK-323 of his mind . some new pieces of 
 music UNK-175 the UNK-745 in the lower room and on his UNK-891 
 stood two volumes by UNK-142 thus UNK-82 UNK-447 and the gay 
 science . he wrote UNK-566 in the UNK-848 of papers which lay in his desk . 
 one of his sentences written two months after his last interview with 
 mrs . UNK-982 read love between man and man is impossible because there 
 must not be sexual UNK-299 and friendship between man and woman is 
 impossible because there must be sexual UNK-299 . he kept away from 
 concerts UNK-689 he should meet her . his father died the junior partner of 
 the bank retired . and still every morning he went into the city by 
 UNK-80 and every evening walked home from the city after having UNK-618 
 UNK-511 in UNK-528 street and read the evening paper for UNK-367 . 
 UNK-0 
 one evening as he was about to put a UNK-817 of UNK-224 beef and UNK-388 
 into his mouth his hand stopped . his eyes fixed themselves on a 
 paragraph in the evening paper which he had UNK-973 against the 
 UNK-92 . he replaced the UNK-817 of food on his plate and read the 
 paragraph UNK-604 . then he UNK-59 a glass of water pushed his plate 
 to one side UNK-307 the paper down before him between his UNK-122 and 
 read the paragraph over and over again . the UNK-388 began to deposit a 
 cold white UNK-985 on his plate . the girl came over to him to ask was 
 his dinner not properly cooked . he said it was very good and ate a few 
 UNK-726 of it with difficulty . then he paid his bill and went out . 
 UNK-0 
 he walked along quickly through the november UNK-391 his UNK-98 UNK-164 
 stick striking the ground regularly the UNK-703 of the UNK-527 mail UNK-991 
 out of a UNK-541 of his tight UNK-52 UNK-319 . on the lonely road 
 which leads from the UNK-4 to UNK-889 he UNK-507 his pace . 
 his stick struck the ground less UNK-695 and his breath UNK-717 
 UNK-653 almost with a UNK-475 sound UNK-583 in the UNK-646 air . 
 when he reached his house he went up at once to his bedroom and taking 
 the paper from his pocket read the paragraph again by the failing light 
 of the window . he read it not UNK-736 but moving his lips as a priest 
 does when he reads the prayers UNK-379 . this was the paragraph

 UNK-0 
 today at the city of dublin hospital the deputy UNK-375 in the absence 
 of mr . UNK-758 held an UNK-455 on the body of mrs . emily UNK-982 aged 
 UNK-85 years who was killed at sydney parade station yesterday 
 evening . the evidence showed that the UNK-396 lady while attempting to 
 cross the line was UNK-442 down by the engine of the ten UNK-270 slow 
 train from UNK-894 thereby UNK-587 injuries of the head and right 
 side which led to her death . 
 UNK-0 
 james UNK-309 driver of the engine stated that he had been in the 
 employment of the railway company for fifteen years . on hearing 
 the guards UNK-266 he set the train in motion and a second or two 
 afterwards brought it to rest in response to loud UNK-155 . the train was 
 going slowly . 
 UNK-0 
 p . UNK-518 railway porter stated that as the train was about to start he 
 observed a woman attempting to cross the lines . he ran towards her and 
 UNK-247 but before he could reach her she was caught by the buffer of 
 the engine and fell to the ground . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-376 . UNK-0 " you saw the lady fall ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 witness . UNK-0 " yes . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 police UNK-616 UNK-335 UNK-124 that when he arrived he found the UNK-396 
 lying on the platform apparently dead . he had the body taken to the 
 UNK-548 pending the arrival of the UNK-423 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-233 UNK-368 UNK-672 . 
 UNK-0 
 dr . UNK-952 assistant house surgeon of the city of dublin hospital 
 stated that the UNK-396 had two lower UNK-905 UNK-730 and had sustained 
 severe UNK-38 of the right shoulder . the right side of the head 
 had been injured in the fall . the injuries were not sufficient to 
 have caused death in a normal person . death in his opinion had been 
 probably due to shock and sudden failure of the hearts action . 
 UNK-0 
 mr . h . b . UNK-697 UNK-830 on behalf of the railway company expressed 
 his deep UNK-675 at the accident . the company had always taken every 
 UNK-11 to prevent people crossing the lines except by the bridges 
 both by placing notices in every station and by the use of patent spring 
 gates at level UNK-895 . the UNK-396 had been in the UNK-158 of crossing 
 the lines late at night from platform to platform and in view of 
 certain other circumstances of the case he did not think the railway 
 officials were to blame . 
 UNK-0 
 captain UNK-982 of UNK-760 sydney parade husband of the UNK-396 
 also gave evidence . he stated that the UNK-396 was his wife . he was 
 not in dublin at the time of the accident as he had arrived only that 
 morning from UNK-680 . they had been married for UNK-405 years and 
 had lived UNK-844 until about two years ago when his wife began to be 
 rather UNK-571 in her habits . 
 UNK-0 
 miss mary UNK-982 said that of late her mother had been in the UNK-158 
 of going out at night to buy spirits . she witness had often tried to 
 reason with her mother and had induced her to join a league . she was not 
 at home until an hour after the accident . the jury returned a UNK-253 
 in accordance with the medical evidence and UNK-780 UNK-309 from all 
 blame . 
 UNK-0 
 the deputy UNK-375 said it was a most painful case and expressed great 
 sympathy with captain UNK-982 and his daughter . he UNK-318 on the railway 
 company to take strong measures to prevent the possibility of similar 
 accidents in the future . no blame attached to anyone . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-355 raised his eyes from the paper and UNK-84 out of his window on 
 the UNK-664 evening landscape . the river lay quiet beside the empty 
 UNK-86 and from time to time a light appeared in some house on the 
 UNK-822 road . what an end ! the whole narrative of her death UNK-128 him 
 and it UNK-128 him to think that he had ever spoken to her of what he 
 held sacred . the UNK-813 phrases the UNK-275 expressions of sympathy 
 the UNK-70 words of a reporter won over to UNK-693 the details of 
 a UNK-164 UNK-314 death attacked his stomach . not merely had she 
 UNK-809 herself she had UNK-809 him . he saw the UNK-707 tract of her 
 vice UNK-786 and UNK-486 . his souls companion ! he thought of 
 the UNK-574 UNK-600 whom he had seen carrying UNK-541 and bottles to 
 be filled by the UNK-375 . just god what an end ! UNK-307 she had been 
 UNK-863 to live without any strength of purpose an easy UNK-659 to habits 
 one of the UNK-322 on which UNK-315 has been UNK-671 . but that she 
 could have UNK-796 so low ! was it possible he had UNK-901 himself 
 so UNK-944 about her ? he remembered her UNK-256 of that night and 
 interpreted it in a UNK-460 sense than he had ever done . he had no 
 difficulty now in UNK-978 of the course he had taken . 
 UNK-0 
 as the light failed and his memory began to UNK-588 he thought her hand 
 touched his . the shock which had first attacked his stomach was now 
 UNK-652 his UNK-510 . he put on his UNK-319 and hat quickly and went 
 out . the cold air met him on the threshold it UNK-270 into the UNK-552 of 
 his coat . when he came to the UNK-722 at UNK-889 bridge he went 
 in and ordered a hot punch . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-382 served him UNK-630 but did not venture to talk . 
 there were five or six UNK-180 in the shop discussing the value of a 
 UNK-885 estate in county UNK-328 they UNK-59 at intervals from their 
 huge UNK-395 UNK-37 and UNK-146 UNK-199 often on the floor and sometimes 
 UNK-873 the UNK-483 over their UNK-206 with their heavy boots . mr . UNK-355 
 sat on his UNK-518 and UNK-84 at them without seeing or hearing them . 
 after a while they went out and he called for another punch . he sat a 
 long time over it . the shop was very quiet . the UNK-382 UNK-350 on 
 the counter reading the herald and UNK-687 . now and again a UNK-80 was 
 heard UNK-730 along the lonely road outside . 
 UNK-0 
 as he sat there living over his life with her and UNK-586 UNK-101 
 the two images in which he now UNK-290 her he UNK-142 that she was 
 dead that she had UNK-167 to exist that she had become a memory . he 
 began to feel ill at ease . he asked himself what else could he have 
 done . he could not have carried on a comedy of UNK-59 with her he 
 could not have lived with her UNK-182 . he had done what seemed to him 
 best . how was he to blame ? now that she was gone he understood how 
 lonely her life must have been sitting night after night alone in that 
 room . his life would be lonely too until he too died UNK-167 to exist 
 became a UNK-186 anyone remembered him . 
 UNK-0 
 it was after nine UNK-270 when he left the shop . the night was cold and 
 UNK-484 . he entered the park by the first gate and walked along under the 
 UNK-421 trees . he walked through the UNK-55 UNK-154 where they had walked 
 four years before . she seemed to be near him in the darkness . at moments 
 he seemed to feel her voice touch his ear her hand touch his . he stood 
 still to listen . why had he UNK-454 life from her ? why had he UNK-763 
 her to death ? he felt his moral nature falling to pieces . 
 UNK-0 
 when he gained the crest of the magazine hill he UNK-46 and looked 
 along the river towards dublin the lights of which UNK-416 UNK-487 and 
 UNK-317 in the cold night . he looked down the slope and at the base 
 in the shadow of the wall of the park he saw some human figures lying . 
 those UNK-625 and UNK-238 loves filled him with UNK-85 . he UNK-416 the 
 UNK-123 of his life he felt that he had been UNK-1 from UNK-667 
 UNK-555 . one human being had seemed to love him and he had denied her life 
 and happiness he had UNK-763 her to UNK-509 a death of shame . he 
 knew that the UNK-425 creatures down by the wall were watching him and 
 UNK-136 him gone . no one wanted him he was UNK-1 from UNK-667 UNK-555 . 
 he turned his eyes to the grey UNK-494 river UNK-407 along towards 
 dublin . beyond the river he saw a goods train UNK-407 out of UNK-58 
 station like a worm with a UNK-163 head UNK-407 through the darkness 
 UNK-118 and UNK-740 . it passed slowly out of sight but still 
 he heard in his ears the UNK-659 UNK-710 of the engine UNK-243 the 
 UNK-500 of her name . 
 UNK-0 
 he turned back the way he had come the rhythm of the engine UNK-562 
 in his ears . he began to doubt the reality of what memory told him . he 
 UNK-46 under a tree and allowed the rhythm to die away . he could not 
 feel her near him in the darkness nor her voice touch his ear . he 
 UNK-56 for some minutes listening . he could hear nothing the night was 
 perfectly silent . he UNK-126 again perfectly silent . he felt that he 
 was alone .

 UNK-390 day in the committee room 
 UNK-0 
 old jack UNK-835 the UNK-186 together with a piece of UNK-991 and spread 
 them UNK-856 over the UNK-628 dome of UNK-918 . when the dome was 
 UNK-141 covered his face UNK-622 into darkness but as he set himself to 
 fan the fire again his UNK-625 shadow UNK-3 the opposite wall and 
 his face slowly UNK-154 into light . it was an old UNK-54 face very 
 UNK-215 and hairy . the UNK-295 blue eyes UNK-713 at the fire and the UNK-295 
 mouth fell open at times UNK-418 once or twice UNK-573 when 
 it closed . when the UNK-186 had caught he laid the piece of UNK-991 
 against the wall UNK-279 and said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " thats better now mr . UNK-60 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-60 a UNK-879 young man whose face was UNK-119 by many 
 UNK-357 and UNK-794 had just brought the tobacco for a cigarette 
 into a UNK-116 cylinder but when spoken to he UNK-939 his UNK-522 
 UNK-72 . then he began to roll the tobacco again UNK-72 and 
 after a moments thought decided to UNK-313 the paper . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " did mr . UNK-813 say when UNK-25 be back ? " UNK-0 he asked in a UNK-668 UNK-570 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " he UNK-3 say . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-60 put his cigarette into his mouth and began search his 
 pockets . he took out a pack of thin UNK-583 cards . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ill get you a match " UNK-0 said the old man . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " never mind UNK-534 do " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-60 . 
 UNK-0 
 he selected one of the cards and read what was printed on it

 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-60 had been engaged by UNK-695 agent to UNK-823 one part of 
 the ward but as the weather was UNK-578 and his boots let in the wet 
 he spent a great part of the day sitting by the fire in the committee 
 room in UNK-777 street with jack the old UNK-72 . they had been 
 sitting thus since the short day had grown dark . it was the sixth of 
 october UNK-771 and cold out of doors . 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-60 UNK-814 a strip off the card and lighting it lit his 
 cigarette . as he did so the flame lit up a leaf of dark UNK-419 UNK-390 the 
 UNK-958 of his coat . the old man watched him UNK-604 and then taking 
 up the piece of UNK-991 again began to fan the fire slowly while his 
 companion UNK-146 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ah yes " UNK-0 he said continuing UNK-0 " its hard to know what way to bring

 the christian brothers and i done what i could for him and there he goes 
 UNK-151 about . i tried to make him UNK-274 decent . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he replaced the UNK-991 UNK-853 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " only im an old man now id change his tune for him . id take the stick 
 to his back and beat him while i could stand over UNK-964 i done many

 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " to be sure it is " UNK-0 said the old man . UNK-0 " and little thanks you get for it

 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what age is he ? " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-60 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-510 " UNK-0 said the old man .

 but sure its worse whenever he gets a job he drinks it all . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-60 UNK-35 his head in sympathy and the old man fell silent 
 UNK-248 into the fire . someone opened the door of the room and called 
 out 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " hello ! is this a UNK-726 meeting ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-169 that ? " UNK-0 said the old man . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what are you doing in the dark ? " UNK-0 asked a voice . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " is that you UNK-45 ? " UNK-0 asked mr . UNK-60 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes . what are you doing in the dark ? " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-45 . UNK-796 into 
 the light of the fire . 
 UNK-0 
 he was a tall UNK-293 young man with a light brown UNK-91 . UNK-468 
 little drops of rain hung at the UNK-233 of his hat and the collar of his 
 UNK-384 was turned up . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well mat " UNK-0 he said to mr . UNK-60 UNK-0 " how goes it ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-60 UNK-35 his head . the old man left the UNK-679 and after 
 UNK-627 about the room returned with two UNK-213 which he UNK-243 
 one after the other into the fire and carried to the table . a UNK-997 
 room came into view and the fire lost all its UNK-217 colour . the walls 
 of the room were bare except for a copy of an election address . in the 
 middle of the room was a small table on which papers were UNK-574 . 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-45 UNK-122 against the UNK-425 and asked 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " has he paid you yet ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " not yet " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-60 . UNK-0 " i hope to god hell not leave us in the

 UNK-60 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what do you think jack ? " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-45 UNK-229 to the old man . 
 UNK-0 
 the old man returned to his seat by the fire saying 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " it UNK-50 but he has it anyway . not like the other UNK-577 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what other UNK-577 ? " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-45 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-974 " UNK-0 said the old man UNK-784 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " it is because UNK-639 a UNK-623 you say that ? whats the 
 difference between a good honest UNK-92 and a UNK-223 ? UNK-696 
 the UNK-623 as good a right to be in the corporation as anyone 
 UNK-395 and a better right than those UNK-649 that are always hat in 
 hand before any fellow with a handle to his name ? UNK-50 that so mat ? " UNK-0 
 said mr . UNK-45 addressing mr . UNK-60 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i think UNK-14 right " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-60 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " one man is a plain honest man with no UNK-12 about him . he goes 
 in to represent the labour classes . this fellow UNK-14 working for only 
 wants to get some job or other . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " of course the UNK-831 should be represented " UNK-0 said the old 
 man . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " the UNK-623 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-45 UNK-0 " gets all UNK-143 and no UNK-936 . but 
 its labour produces everything . the UNK-623 is not looking for fat 
 jobs for his sons and UNK-595 and UNK-565 . the UNK-623 is not going 
 to drag the UNK-88 of dublin in the mud to please a german UNK-876 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-580 that ? " UNK-0 said the old man . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " dont you know they want to present an address of welcome to edward 
 UNK-446 if he comes here next year ? what do we want UNK-559 to a foreign 
 king ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " our man UNK-19 vote for the address " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-60 . UNK-0 " he goes in on 
 the UNK-551 ticket . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-19 he ? " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-45 . UNK-0 " wait till you see whether he will or not . i 
 know him . is it UNK-497 UNK-402 UNK-813 ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " by god ! perhaps UNK-14 right joe " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-60 . UNK-0 " anyway i wish 
 UNK-25 turn up with the UNK-161 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the three men fell silent . the old man began to UNK-780 more UNK-186 
 together . mr . UNK-45 took off his hat UNK-35 it and then turned down the 
 collar of his coat displaying as he did so an UNK-390 leaf in the UNK-958 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " if this man was alive " UNK-0 he said pointing to the leaf UNK-0 " wed have no 
 talk of an address of welcome . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " thats true " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-60 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-109 god be with them times ! " UNK-0 said the old man . UNK-0 " there was some life 
 in it then . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the room was silent again . then a UNK-142 little man with a UNK-478 
 nose and very cold ears pushed in the door . he walked over quickly to 
 the fire UNK-166 his hands as if he intended to produce a UNK-125 from 
 them . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no money boys " UNK-0 he said . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " sit down here mr . UNK-70 " UNK-0 said the old man offering him his chair . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o dont UNK-94 jack dont UNK-94 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-146 UNK-518 to mr . UNK-45 and sat down on the chair which the old 
 man UNK-325 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " did you serve UNK-307 street ? " UNK-0 he asked mr . UNK-60 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-60 beginning to search his pockets for UNK-192 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " did you call on UNK-895 ? " UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " he asked me who the UNK-603 were and i told him . i mentioned father 
 UNK-222 name . i think UNK-404 be all right . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-70 began to UNK-281 and to UNK-936 his hands over the fire at a 
 UNK-92 speed . then he said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " for the love of god jack bring us a bit of coal . there must be some 
 left . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the old man went out of the room . 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 the old man returned with a few UNK-882 of coal which he placed here and 
 there on the fire . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " thats a nice UNK-359 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-60 . UNK-0 " how does he expect us

 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i cant help it " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 . UNK-0 " i expect to find the UNK-342 in

 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-45 UNK-20 and UNK-448 himself away from the UNK-425 with 
 the aid of his UNK-61 made ready to leave . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-404 be all right when king eddie comes " UNK-0 he said . UNK-0 " well boys im off 
 for the present . see you later . bye bye . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he went out of the room slowly . neither mr . UNK-70 nor the old man said 
 anything but just as the door was closing mr . UNK-60 who had been 
 UNK-151 UNK-476 into the fire called out suddenly 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " bye joe . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-70 UNK-56 a few moments and then UNK-146 in the direction of the 
 door .

 into the fire UNK-0 " UNK-2 hard up like the rest of us . " UNK-0

 UNK-0 " let him work for his own side and not come UNK-905 around here . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i dont know " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-60 UNK-644 as he took out

 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " some of these UNK-491 and UNK-869 are a bit too UNK-324 if you ask me " UNK-0 
 said mr . UNK-70 . UNK-0 " do you know what my private and UNK-98 opinion is

 UNK-0 
 there was a knock at the door . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " come in ! " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 . 
 UNK-0 
 a person UNK-893 a poor UNK-41 or a poor actor appeared in the 
 UNK-102 . his black clothes were UNK-651 UNK-872 on his short body 
 and it was impossible to say whether he UNK-71 a UNK-833 collar or 
 a UNK-226 because the collar of his UNK-152 UNK-423 the UNK-300 
 buttons of which reflected the UNK-693 was turned up about his 
 neck . he UNK-71 a round hat of hard black felt . his face UNK-160 with 
 UNK-821 had the appearance of UNK-261 yellow cheese save where two UNK-716 
 spots indicated the UNK-508 . he opened his very long mouth suddenly 
 to express UNK-965 and at the same time opened wide his very 
 bright blue eyes to express pleasure and surprise . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o father UNK-832 ! " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 jumping up from his chair . UNK-0 " is that

 UNK-0

 were addressing a child . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-19 you come in and sit down ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no no no ! " UNK-0 said father UNK-832 speaking in a UNK-317 UNK-366 
 UNK-684 voice . UNK-0 " dont let me UNK-821 you now ! im just looking for mr . 
 UNK-463 . . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-2 round at the black eagle " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 . UNK-0 " but UNK-19 you come in

 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no no thank you . it was just a little business matter " UNK-0 said father 
 UNK-832 . UNK-0 " thank you indeed . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-486 from the UNK-102 and mr . UNK-70 UNK-103 one of the 
 UNK-213 went to the door to light him UNK-627 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o dont trouble i UNK-429 ! " UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " are you right now ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " all right thanks . . . . thanks . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-70 returned with the UNK-599 and put it on the table . he sat 
 down again at the fire . there was silence for a few moments . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " tell me john " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-60 lighting his cigarette with another 
 UNK-583 card . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-723 ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what he is exactly ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ask me an easier one " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-463 and himself seem to me very thick . UNK-30 often in UNK-107 
 together . is he a priest at all ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-669 i believe so . . . . i think UNK-2 what you call a black sheep .

 UNK-4 man of some kind . . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and how does he knock it out ? " UNK-0 asked mr . UNK-60 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " thats another mystery . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " is he attached to any chapel or church or institution or " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 UNK-0 " i think UNK-2 travelling on his own account . . . .

 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " is there any chance of a drink itself ? " UNK-0 asked mr . UNK-60 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " im dry too " UNK-0 said the old man . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i asked that little UNK-866 three times " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 UNK-0 " would he 
 send up a dozen of UNK-98 . i asked him again now but he was UNK-200 
 on the counter in his UNK-775 having a deep UNK-203 with UNK-998 
 UNK-123 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " why UNK-3 you remind him ? " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-60 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well i UNK-18 go over while he was talking to UNK-998 UNK-123 . i 
 just UNK-56 till i caught his eye and said about that little matter i 
 was speaking to you about . . . . UNK-397 be all right mr . h . he said . 
 UNK-725 sure the little UNK-126 has forgotten all about it . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-6 some deal on in that quarter " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-60 UNK-711 . 
 UNK-0 " i saw the three of them hard at it yesterday at UNK-587 street corner . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i think i know the little game UNK-30 at " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 . UNK-0 " you must

 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-60 UNK-20 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " so far as UNK-812 money goes . . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " driving out of the UNK-229 house " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 UNK-0 " in all my UNK-579 
 with jack here standing up behind me in a UNK-239 UNK-385 ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and make me your private secretary john . " UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what ? " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 and mr . UNK-60 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " he told me what do you think of a lord mayor of dublin sending out

 the UNK-229 house . UNK-28 ! says i what kind of people is going at 
 all now ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 at this point there was a knock at the door and a boy put in his head . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what is it ? " UNK-0 said the old man . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " from the black eagle " UNK-0 said the boy walking in UNK-174 and UNK-195 
 a basket on the floor with a noise of UNK-491 bottles . 
 UNK-0 
 the old man helped the boy to transfer the bottles from the basket to 
 the table and counted the full UNK-990 . after the transfer the boy put his 
 basket on his arm and asked 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " any bottles ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what bottles ? " UNK-0 said the old man . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-19 you let us drink them first ? " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i was told to ask for the bottles . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " come back tomorrow " UNK-0 said the old man . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " here boy ! " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 UNK-0 " will you run over to UNK-455 and ask 
 him to UNK-545 us a UNK-25 mr . UNK-70 say . tell him we UNK-19 keep 
 it a minute . leave the basket there . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the boy went out and mr . UNK-70 began to UNK-936 his hands UNK-929 
 saying 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ah well UNK-2 not so bad after all . UNK-2 as good as his word UNK-58 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-6 no UNK-37 " UNK-0 said the old man . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o dont let that trouble you jack " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 . UNK-0 " UNK-10 the good 
 man before now UNK-59 out of the bottle . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " anyway its better than nothing " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-60 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-2 not a bad sort " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 UNK-0 " only UNK-463 has such a loan of 
 him . he means well you know in his own UNK-413 way . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the boy came back with the UNK-257 . the old man opened three bottles 
 and was UNK-682 back the UNK-257 when mr . UNK-70 said to the boy 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " would you like a drink boy ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " if you please sir " UNK-0 said the boy . 
 UNK-0 
 the old man opened another bottle UNK-467 and handed it to the boy . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what age are you ? " UNK-0 he asked . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-538 " UNK-0 said the boy . 
 UNK-0 
 as the old man said nothing further the boy took the bottle and said 
 UNK-0 " UNK-182 my best UNK-640 sir " UNK-0 to mr . UNK-70 UNK-59 the contents put 
 the bottle back on the table and UNK-702 his mouth with his sleeve . then 
 he took up the UNK-257 and went out of the door UNK-174 UNK-794 
 some form of UNK-86 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " thats the way it begins " UNK-0 said the old man . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " the thin edge of the UNK-836 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 . 
 UNK-0 
 the old man distributed the three bottles which he had opened and the 
 men UNK-59 from them simultaneously . after having drunk each placed his 
 bottle on the UNK-425 within hands reach and drew in a long breath 
 of satisfaction . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well i did a good days work today " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 after a UNK-242 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " that so john ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes . i got him one or two sure things in UNK-580 street UNK-250 and 
 myself . between ourselves you know UNK-250 UNK-2 a decent UNK-26 of 
 course but UNK-2 not worth a damn as a UNK-532 . he UNK-696 a word 
 to throw to a dog . he stands and looks at the people while i do the 
 talking . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 here two men entered the room . one of them was a very fat man whose blue 
 UNK-165 clothes seemed to be in danger of falling from his UNK-576 figure . 
 he had a big face which UNK-670 a young UNK-627 face in expression 
 UNK-151 blue eyes and a UNK-635 UNK-91 . the other man who was much 
 younger and UNK-82 had a thin UNK-59 face . he UNK-71 a very high 
 double collar and a UNK-764 UNK-960 hat . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " hello UNK-250 ! " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 to the fat man . UNK-0 " talk of the devil . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " where did the UNK-118 come from ? " UNK-0 asked the young man . UNK-0 " did the cow 
 UNK-278 ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o of course UNK-152 spots the drink first thing ! " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-60 
 laughing . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " is that the way you UNK-644 UNK-823 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-152 UNK-0 " and UNK-250 and i 
 out in the cold and rain looking for votes ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " why blast your soul " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 UNK-0 " id get more votes in five 
 minutes than you UNK-435 get in a week . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " open two bottles of UNK-98 jack " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-60 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " how can i ? " UNK-0 said the old man UNK-0 " when UNK-6 no UNK-257 ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " wait now wait now ! " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 getting up quickly . UNK-0 " did you ever 
 see this little trick ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he took two bottles from the table and carrying them to the fire put 
 them on the UNK-182 . then he sat down again by the fire and took another 
 drink from his bottle . mr . UNK-152 sat on the edge of the table pushed 
 his hat towards the UNK-157 of his neck and began to swing his legs . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " which is my bottle ? " UNK-0 he asked . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " this UNK-5 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 . 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-250 sat down on a box and looked UNK-663 at the other bottle on 
 the UNK-182 . he was silent for two reasons . the first reason sufficient in 
 itself was that he had nothing to say the second reason was that 
 he considered his UNK-193 beneath him . he had been a UNK-532 for 
 UNK-772 the conservative but when the UNK-444 had UNK-275 
 their man and choosing the lesser of two UNK-473 given their support to 
 the UNK-551 candidate he had been engaged to work for mr . UNK-264 . 
 UNK-0 
 in a few minutes an UNK-228 UNK-0 " UNK-68 ! " UNK-0 was heard as the cork UNK-230 out 
 of mr . UNK-152 bottle . mr . UNK-152 UNK-615 off the table went to the fire 
 took his bottle and carried it back to the table . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i was just telling them UNK-250 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 UNK-0 " that we got a good 
 few votes today . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " who did you get ? " UNK-0 asked mr . UNK-152 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well i got UNK-401 for one and i got UNK-550 for two and got ward 
 of UNK-580 street . fine old UNK-26 he is UNK-360 old UNK-190 old 
 conservative ! but UNK-50 your candidate a UNK-551 ? said he . UNK-2 a 
 UNK-667 man said i . UNK-2 in favour of whatever will benefit this 
 country . UNK-2 a big UNK-141 i said . he has extensive house property 
 in the city and three places of business and UNK-50 it to his own 
 advantage to keep down the rates ? UNK-2 a prominent and respected 
 citizen said i and a poor law guardian and he UNK-55 belong to any 
 party good bad or UNK-942 . thats the way to talk to em . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and what about the address to the king ? " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-152 after drinking 
 and UNK-463 his lips . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " listen to me " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 . UNK-0 " what we want in this country as i 
 said to old ward is capital . the kings coming here will mean an UNK-61 
 of money into this country . the citizens of dublin will benefit by it . 
 look at all the UNK-359 down by the UNK-719 there idle ! look at all the 
 money there is in the country if we only worked the old industries the 
 mills the UNK-808 yards and UNK-359 . its capital we want . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but look here john " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-60 . UNK-0 " why should we welcome the 
 king of england ? UNK-3 UNK-121 himself . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-121 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 UNK-0 " is dead . now UNK-182 the way i look at it . 
 UNK-182 this UNK-26 come to the UNK-980 after his old mother keeping him out 
 of it till the man was grey . UNK-2 a man of the world and he means 
 well by us . UNK-2 a UNK-236 fine decent fellow if you ask me and no damn 
 UNK-221 about him . he just says to himself the old one never went 
 to see these wild irish . by christ ill go myself and see what UNK-30 
 like . and are we going to UNK-651 the man when he comes over here on a 
 friendly visit ? eh ? UNK-50 that right UNK-250 ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-250 UNK-146 his head . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but after all now " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-152 UNK-639 UNK-0 " king edwards 
 life you know is not the very . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " let UNK-680 be UNK-680 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 . UNK-0 " i UNK-859 the man personally . 
 UNK-2 just an ordinary UNK-335 like you and me . UNK-2 UNK-345 of his glass 
 of UNK-973 and UNK-2 a bit of a UNK-780 perhaps and UNK-2 a good UNK-420 . 
 damn it cant we irish play fair ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " thats all very fine " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-152 . UNK-0 " but look at the case of UNK-121 
 now . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " in the name of god " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 UNK-0 " UNK-189 the UNK-895 between the 
 two cases ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what i mean " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-152 UNK-0 " is we have our UNK-8 . why now would 
 we welcome a man like that ? do you think now after what he did UNK-121 
 was a fit man to lead us ? and why then would we do it for edward the 
 seventh ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " this is UNK-855 anniversary " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-60 UNK-0 " and dont let 
 us UNK-94 up any bad blood . we all respect him now that UNK-2 dead and 
 UNK-611 the UNK-444 " UNK-0 he added turning to mr . UNK-250 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-68 ! the UNK-128 cork UNK-230 out of mr . UNK-471 bottle . mr . UNK-250 got 
 up from his box and went to the fire . as he returned with his capture he 
 said in a deep voice 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " our side of the house UNK-640 him because he was a gentleman . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " right you are UNK-250 ! " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-70 UNK-809 . UNK-0 " he was the only man

 UNK-0 " o that thing is it . . . . sure thats old now . " UNK-0

 his hat laid it on the table and stood up . he seemed to be UNK-629 
 the piece in his mind . after a rather long UNK-242 he announced 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-45 sat down again on the table . when he had finished his 
 UNK-826 there was a silence and then a burst of UNK-374 even mr . 
 UNK-152 UNK-27 . the UNK-541 continued for a little time . when it had 
 UNK-167 all the UNK-852 UNK-59 from their bottles in silence . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-68 ! the cork UNK-230 out of mr . UNK-45 bottle but mr . UNK-45 remained 
 sitting UNK-327 and UNK-639 on the table . he did not seem to have 
 heard the invitation . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " good man joe ! " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-60 taking out his cigarette papers and 
 UNK-336 the better to hide his UNK-370 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what do you think of that UNK-250 ? " UNK-0 UNK-5 mr . UNK-70 . UNK-0 " UNK-50 that 
 fine ? what ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-250 said that it was a very fine piece of writing . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-106 assistant secretary of the UNK-438 abu society had been 
 walking up and down dublin for nearly a month with his hands and 
 pockets full of dirty pieces of paper UNK-316 about the series of 
 concerts . he had a game leg and for this his friends called him UNK-512 
 UNK-106 . he walked up and down constantly stood by the hour at street 
 corners UNK-957 the point and made notes but in the end it was mrs . 
 UNK-63 who arranged everything . 
 UNK-0 
 miss UNK-546 had become mrs . UNK-63 out of UNK-300 . she had been educated 
 in a UNK-440 UNK-575 where she had learned french and music . as 
 she was naturally pale and UNK-912 in manner she made few friends at 
 school . when she came to the age of marriage she was sent out to many 
 houses where her playing and ivory UNK-347 were much UNK-336 . she sat 
 UNK-22 the UNK-618 circle of her UNK-830 waiting for some UNK-158 
 to brave it and offer her a brilliant life . but the young men whom she 
 met were ordinary and she gave them no UNK-2 trying to console 
 her romantic UNK-46 by eating a great deal of turkish delight in 
 secret . however when she drew near the limit and her friends began 
 to UNK-923 their UNK-591 about her she UNK-516 them by UNK-244 mr . 
 UNK-63 who was a UNK-453 on UNK-421 UNK-118 . 
 UNK-0 
 he was much older than she . his conversation which was serious took 
 place at intervals in his great brown UNK-153 . after the first year of 
 married life mrs . UNK-63 perceived that such a man would wear better 
 than a romantic person but she never put her own romantic ideas away . 
 he was UNK-357 UNK-890 and UNK-290 he went to the UNK-92 every first 
 friday sometimes with her UNK-730 by himself . but she never UNK-929 
 in her religion and was a good wife to him . at some party in a strange 
 house when she UNK-64 her UNK-394 ever so slightly he stood up to take 
 his leave and when his UNK-766 UNK-371 him she put the UNK-290 quilt 
 over his feet and made a strong UNK-647 punch . for his part he was a model 
 father . by paying a small sum every week into a society he UNK-552 for 
 both his daughters a UNK-55 of one hundred pounds each when they came to 
 the age of UNK-881 . he sent the older daughter UNK-464 to a good 
 UNK-575 where she learned french and music and UNK-348 paid her 
 fees at the academy . every year in the month of july mrs . UNK-63 found 
 occasion to say to some friend 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " my good man is packing us off to UNK-497 for a few weeks . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 if it was not UNK-497 it was UNK-301 or UNK-846 . 
 UNK-0 
 when the irish UNK-35 began to be UNK-6 mrs . UNK-63 determined 
 to take advantage of her daughters name and brought an irish teacher to 
 the house . UNK-464 and her sister sent irish picture postcards to their 
 friends and these friends sent back other irish picture postcards . 
 on special UNK-822 when mr . UNK-63 went with his family to the 
 UNK-453 a little crowd of people would UNK-843 after mass at 
 the corner of cathedral street . they were all friends of the 
 UNK-649 friends or UNK-551 friends and when they had 
 played every little counter of gossip they UNK-35 hands with one 
 another all together laughing at the crossing of so many hands and said 
 UNK-244 to one another in irish . soon the name of miss UNK-464 UNK-63 
 began to be heard often on peoples lips . people said that she was 
 very UNK-324 at music and a very nice girl and moreover that she was 
 a UNK-563 in the language movement . mrs . UNK-63 was well content at 
 this . therefore she was not surprised when one day mr . UNK-106 came to 
 her and proposed that her daughter should be the UNK-43 at a 
 series of four grand concerts which his society was going to give in the 
 UNK-315 concert rooms . she brought him into the UNK-411 made him 
 sit down and brought out the UNK-933 and the silver UNK-328 . she 
 entered heart and soul into the details of the enterprise advised and 
 UNK-239 and finally a contract was drawn up by which UNK-464 was to 
 receive eight UNK-472 for her services as UNK-43 at the four grand 
 concerts . 
 UNK-0 
 as mr . UNK-106 was a UNK-777 in such UNK-325 matters as the UNK-648 of 
 bills and the UNK-380 of items for a programme mrs . UNK-63 helped 
 him . she had UNK-159 . she knew what UNK-842 should go into UNK-686 and 
 what UNK-842 should go into small type . she knew that the first UNK-228 
 would not like to come on after mr . UNK-666 comic turn . to keep the 
 audience continually UNK-917 she UNK-728 the UNK-482 items in between 
 the old favourites . mr . UNK-106 called to see her every day to have her 
 advice on some point . she was UNK-327 friendly and UNK-398 
 in fact . she pushed the UNK-933 towards him saying 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " now help yourself mr . UNK-106 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 and while he was helping himself she said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " dont be afraid ! dont be afraid of it ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 everything went on UNK-93 . mrs . UNK-63 bought some lovely UNK-527 
 UNK-543 in brown UNK-110 to let into the front of UNK-221 dress . 
 it cost a pretty penny but there are occasions when a little expense 
 is UNK-47 . she took a dozen of UNK-44 tickets for the final 
 concert and sent them to those friends who could not be trusted to come 
 otherwise . she forgot nothing and thanks to her everything that was 
 to be done was done . 
 UNK-0 
 the concerts were to be on wednesday thursday friday and saturday . 
 when mrs . UNK-63 arrived with her daughter at the UNK-315 concert rooms 
 on wednesday night she did not like the look of things . a few young men 
 wearing bright blue UNK-750 in their UNK-811 stood idle in the UNK-625 
 none of them UNK-71 evening dress . she passed by with her daughter and a 
 quick glance through the open door of the hall showed her the cause of 
 the UNK-323 UNK-924 . at first she UNK-105 had she UNK-298 the hour . 
 no it was twenty minutes to eight . 
 UNK-0 
 in the UNK-902 behind the stage she was introduced to the 
 secretary of the society mr . UNK-486 . she UNK-24 and UNK-35 his 
 hand . he was a little man with a white UNK-841 face . she noticed that 
 he UNK-71 his soft brown hat UNK-493 on the side of his head and that 
 his accent was flat . he held a programme in his hand and while he was 
 talking to her he UNK-24 one end of it into a UNK-295 UNK-399 . he seemed 
 to bear UNK-314 UNK-79 . mr . UNK-106 came into the UNK-902 
 every few minutes with reports from the UNK-913 . the UNK-842 talked 
 among themselves UNK-409 UNK-75 from time to time at the mirror and 
 rolled and UNK-951 their music . when it was nearly UNK-638 eight the 
 few people in the hall began to express their desire to be UNK-940 . 
 mr . UNK-486 came in UNK-24 UNK-596 at the room and said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well now ladies and UNK-32 . i suppose wed better open the ball . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mrs . UNK-63 UNK-582 his very flat final UNK-758 with a quick UNK-855 of 
 UNK-251 and then said to her daughter UNK-468 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " are you ready dear ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 when she had an opportunity she called mr . UNK-106 aside and asked him 
 to tell her what it meant . mr . UNK-106 did not know what it meant . 
 he said that the committee had made a mistake in UNK-316 for four 
 concerts four was too many . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and the UNK-842 ! " UNK-0 said mrs . UNK-63 . UNK-0 " of course they are doing their 
 best but really they are not good . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-106 admitted that the UNK-842 were no good but the committee 
 he said had decided to let the first three concerts go as they pleased 
 and reserve all the talent for saturday night . mrs . UNK-63 said 
 nothing but as the UNK-63 items followed one another on the platform 
 and the few people in the hall grew fewer and fewer she began to UNK-675 
 that she had put herself to any expense for such a concert . there was 
 something she UNK-3 like in the look of things and mr . UNK-920 
 UNK-841 smile UNK-120 her very much . however she said nothing and 
 UNK-56 to see how it would end . the concert expired shortly before ten 
 and everyone went home quickly . 
 UNK-0 
 the concert on thursday night was better attended but mrs . UNK-63 
 saw at once that the house was filled with paper . the audience UNK-472 
 UNK-97 as if the concert were an informal dress UNK-935 . mr . 
 UNK-486 seemed to enjoy himself he was quite UNK-225 that mrs . 
 UNK-63 was taking angry note of his conduct . he stood at the edge of 
 the screen from time to time UNK-805 out his head and UNK-897 a 
 laugh with two friends in the corner of the UNK-994 . in the course of 
 the evening mrs . UNK-63 learned that the friday concert was to be 
 abandoned and that the committee was going to move heaven and earth to 
 secure a bumper house on saturday night . when she heard this she sought 
 out mr . UNK-106 . she UNK-653 him as he was UNK-403 out quickly with 
 a glass of UNK-543 for a young lady and asked him was it true . yes it 
 was true . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but of course that UNK-55 alter the contract " UNK-0 she said . UNK-0 " the 
 contract was for four concerts . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-106 seemed to be in a UNK-282 he advised her to speak to mr . 
 UNK-486 . mrs . UNK-63 was now beginning to be UNK-720 . she called 
 mr . UNK-486 away from his screen and told him that her daughter had 
 signed for four concerts and that of course according to the terms 
 of the contract she should receive the sum originally UNK-788 for 
 whether the society gave the four concerts or not . mr . UNK-486 who 
 did not catch the point at issue very quickly seemed unable to resolve 
 the difficulty and said that he would bring the matter before the 
 committee . mrs . UNK-67 anger began to UNK-782 in her UNK-139 and she 
 had all she could do to keep from asking 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and who is the UNK-469 pray ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 but she knew that it would not be UNK-872 to do that so she was 
 silent . 
 UNK-0 
 little boys were sent out into the principal streets of dublin early on 
 friday morning with UNK-449 of UNK-980 . special UNK-575 appeared in all 
 the evening papers UNK-757 the UNK-456 public of the treat which 
 was in store for it on the following evening . mrs . UNK-63 was 
 somewhat UNK-916 but she thought well to tell her husband part of 
 her UNK-217 . he UNK-126 carefully and said that perhaps it would be 
 better if he went with her on saturday night . she agreed . she respected 
 her husband in the same way as she respected the general post office as 
 something large secure and fixed and though she knew the small number 
 of his UNK-958 she appreciated his abstract value as a male . she was 
 glad that he had suggested coming with her . she thought her plans over . 
 UNK-0 
 the night of the grand concert came . mrs . UNK-63 with her husband and 
 daughter arrived at the UNK-315 concert rooms UNK-846 of an hour 
 before the time at which the concert was to begin . by ill luck it was a 
 UNK-726 evening . mrs . UNK-63 placed her daughters clothes and music in 
 charge of her husband and went all over the building looking for mr . 
 UNK-106 or mr . UNK-486 . she could find neither . she asked the 
 UNK-323 was any member of the committee in the hall and after a great 
 deal of trouble a UNK-187 brought out a little woman named miss 
 UNK-718 to whom mrs . UNK-63 explained that she wanted to see one of the 
 UNK-806 . miss UNK-718 expected them any minute and asked could she do 
 anything . mrs . UNK-63 looked UNK-948 at the UNK-51 face which was 
 UNK-960 into an expression of UNK-645 and UNK-311 and answered 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no thank you ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the little woman hoped they would have a good house . she looked out 
 at the rain until the UNK-724 of the wet street UNK-596 all the 
 UNK-645 and UNK-311 from her twisted features . then she gave a 
 little UNK-317 and said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ah well ! we did our best the dear knows . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mrs . UNK-63 had to go back to the UNK-902 . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-842 were UNK-44 . the bass and the second UNK-228 had already 
 come . the bass mr . UNK-333 was a UNK-293 young man with a UNK-824 
 black UNK-91 . he was the son of a hall porter in an office in the 
 city and as a boy he had UNK-903 UNK-609 bass notes in the UNK-403 
 hall . from this UNK-369 state he had raised himself until he had become 
 a UNK-431 UNK-612 . he had appeared in grand opera . one night when an 
 UNK-555 UNK-612 had fallen ill he had undertaken the part of the king 
 in the opera of UNK-267 at the queens theatre . he UNK-57 his music with 
 great feeling and volume and was UNK-807 UNK-208 by the gallery but 
 unfortunately he UNK-588 the good impression by UNK-859 his nose in his 
 UNK-354 hand once or twice out of UNK-881 . he was UNK-154 and 
 spoke little . he said UNK-778 so UNK-41 that it passed UNK-449 and he 
 never UNK-59 anything stronger than milk for his voices sake . mr . bell 
 the second UNK-228 was a UNK-374 little man who UNK-178 every year 
 for prizes at the UNK-806 UNK-237 . on his fourth trial he had been awarded 
 a bronze medal . he was extremely nervous and extremely UNK-528 of 
 other UNK-198 and he covered his nervous UNK-315 with an UNK-205 
 UNK-99 . it was his UNK-179 to have people know what an UNK-868 a 
 concert was to him . therefore when he saw mr . UNK-333 he went over to him 
 and asked 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " are you in it too ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-333 . 
 UNK-0 
 mr . bell UNK-20 at his UNK-225 held out his hand and said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " shake ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mrs . UNK-63 passed by these two young men and went to the edge of the 
 screen to view the house . the seats were being filled up rapidly and a 
 pleasant noise UNK-629 in the UNK-934 . she came back and spoke to 
 her husband UNK-161 . their conversation was UNK-307 about UNK-464 
 for they both UNK-75 at her often as she stood UNK-176 to one of her 
 UNK-551 friends miss UNK-586 the UNK-77 . an unknown UNK-946 
 woman with a pale face walked through the room . the women followed with 
 keen eyes the UNK-238 blue dress which was UNK-269 upon a UNK-973 body . 
 someone said that she was UNK-280 UNK-687 the UNK-920 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i wonder where did they dig her up " UNK-0 said UNK-464 to miss UNK-586 . UNK-0 " im 
 sure i never heard of her . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 miss UNK-586 had to smile . mr . UNK-106 UNK-114 into the UNK-902 
 at that moment and the two young ladies asked him who was the unknown 
 woman . mr . UNK-106 said that she was UNK-280 UNK-687 from london . UNK-280 
 UNK-687 took her stand in a corner of the room holding a roll of music 
 UNK-255 before her and from time to time changing the direction of her 
 UNK-66 UNK-49 . the shadow took her UNK-238 dress into shelter but fell 
 UNK-240 into the little cup behind her UNK-83 . the noise of 
 the hall became more UNK-557 . the first UNK-228 and the UNK-232 arrived 
 together . they were both well dressed UNK-98 and UNK-840 and they 
 brought a breath of UNK-966 among the company . 
 UNK-0 
 mrs . UNK-63 brought her daughter over to them and talked to them 
 UNK-760 . she wanted to be on good terms with them but while she UNK-952 
 to be UNK-727 her eyes followed mr . UNK-106 in his UNK-403 and UNK-952 
 courses . as soon as she could she UNK-464 herself and went out after 
 him . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " mr . UNK-106 i want to speak to you for a moment " UNK-0 she said . 
 UNK-0 
 they went down to a UNK-317 part of the UNK-366 . mrs UNK-63 asked 
 him when was her daughter going to be paid . mr . UNK-106 said that mr . 
 UNK-486 had charge of that . mrs . UNK-63 said that she UNK-3 know 
 anything about mr . UNK-486 . her daughter had signed a contract for 
 eight UNK-472 and she would have to be paid . mr . UNK-106 said that it 
 UNK-69 his business . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " why UNK-50 it your business ? " UNK-0 asked mrs . UNK-63 . UNK-0 " UNK-3 you yourself 
 bring her the contract ? anyway if its not your business its my 
 business and i mean to see to it . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-306 better speak to mr . UNK-486 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-106 UNK-558 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i dont know anything about mr . UNK-486 " UNK-0 repeated mrs . UNK-63 . UNK-0 " i 
 have my contract and i intend to see that it is carried out . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 when she came back to the UNK-902 her UNK-145 were slightly 
 UNK-197 . the room was UNK-334 . two men in outdoor dress had taken 
 possession of the fireplace and were UNK-176 UNK-108 with miss UNK-586 
 and the UNK-232 . they were the UNK-308 man and mr . UNK-206 burke . the 
 UNK-308 man had come in to say that he could not wait for the concert as 
 he had to report the lecture which an american priest was giving in 
 the UNK-229 house . he said they were to leave the report for him at the 
 UNK-308 office and he would see that it went in . he was a UNK-879 
 man with a UNK-584 voice and careful UNK-347 . he held an UNK-914 
 UNK-455 in his hand and the UNK-493 of UNK-455 smoke UNK-973 near him . he had 
 not intended to stay a moment because concerts and UNK-842 bored him 
 UNK-490 but he remained UNK-200 against the UNK-425 . miss 
 UNK-586 stood in front of him talking and laughing . he was old enough to 
 suspect one reason for her UNK-474 but young enough in spirit to 
 turn the moment to account . the UNK-635 fragrance and colour of her body 
 UNK-177 to his UNK-344 . he was UNK-477 conscious that the UNK-186 which 
 he saw rise and fall slowly beneath him rose and fell at that moment 
 for him that the UNK-31 and fragrance and UNK-20 UNK-26 were his 
 tribute . when he could stay no longer he took leave of her UNK-729 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-206 burke will write the notice " UNK-0 he explained to mr . UNK-106 
 UNK-0 " and ill see it in . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " thank you very much mr . UNK-112 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-106 UNK-0 " UNK-85 see it 
 in i know . now UNK-19 you have a little something before you go ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i dont mind " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-112 . 
 UNK-0 
 the two men went along some UNK-452 UNK-409 and up a dark UNK-116 
 and came to a UNK-544 room where one of the UNK-323 was UNK-224 
 bottles for a few UNK-32 . one of these UNK-32 was mr . UNK-206 
 burke who had found out the room by UNK-375 . he was a UNK-144 elderly 
 man who balanced his UNK-73 body when at rest upon a large silk 
 UNK-148 . his UNK-808 western name was the moral UNK-148 upon 
 which he balanced the fine problem of his finances . he was widely 
 respected . 
 UNK-0 
 while mr . UNK-106 was entertaining the UNK-308 man mrs . UNK-63 was 
 speaking so UNK-827 to her husband that he had to ask her to lower 
 her voice . the conversation of the others in the UNK-902 had 
 become UNK-434 . mr . bell the first item stood ready with his music 
 but the UNK-43 made no sign . UNK-307 something was wrong . mr . 
 UNK-63 looked straight before him UNK-188 his UNK-153 while mrs . 
 UNK-63 spoke into UNK-221 ear with UNK-922 emphasis . from the hall 
 came sounds of UNK-2 UNK-374 and UNK-349 of feet . the 
 first UNK-228 and the UNK-232 and miss UNK-586 stood together waiting 
 UNK-743 but mr . UNK-215 UNK-510 were greatly UNK-923 because he was 
 afraid the audience would think that he had come late . 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-106 and mr . UNK-206 burke came into the room . in a moment mr . 
 UNK-106 perceived the UNK-218 . he went over to mrs . UNK-63 and spoke 
 with her UNK-519 . while they were speaking the noise in the hall grew 
 UNK-339 . mr . UNK-106 became very red and excited . he spoke UNK-986 but 
 mrs . UNK-63 said UNK-518 at intervals 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " she UNK-19 go on . she must get her eight UNK-472 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-106 pointed UNK-893 towards the hall where the audience was 
 UNK-374 and UNK-349 . he UNK-177 to mr UNK-63 and to UNK-464 . but 
 mr . UNK-63 continued to stroke his UNK-153 and UNK-464 looked down 
 moving the point of her new shoe it was not her fault . mrs . UNK-63 
 repeated 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " she UNK-19 go on without her money . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 after a swift struggle of UNK-591 mr . UNK-106 UNK-485 out in UNK-803 . 
 the room was silent . when the strain of the silence had become somewhat 
 painful miss UNK-586 said to the UNK-232 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " have you seen mrs . pat campbell this week ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-232 had not seen her but he had been told that she was very 
 fine . the conversation went no further . the first UNK-228 bent his head 
 and began to count the links of the gold chain which was extended across 
 his UNK-599 UNK-21 and UNK-997 random notes to observe the effect on the 
 UNK-644 UNK-405 . from time to time everyone UNK-75 at mrs . UNK-63 . 
 UNK-0 
 the noise in the UNK-934 had UNK-482 to a UNK-216 when mr . UNK-486 
 burst into the room followed by mr . UNK-106 who was UNK-572 . the 
 UNK-374 and UNK-349 in the hall were UNK-572 by UNK-604 . mr . 
 UNK-486 held a few UNK-620 in his hand . he counted out four 
 into mrs . UNK-67 hand and said she would get the other half at the 
 interval . mrs . UNK-63 said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " this is four UNK-51 short . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 but UNK-464 gathered in her skirt and said UNK-0 " now mr . bell " UNK-0 to 
 the first item who was UNK-144 like an UNK-824 . the singer and the 
 UNK-43 went out together . the noise in hall died away . there was a 
 UNK-242 of a few seconds and then the piano was heard . 
 UNK-0 
 the first part of the concert was very successful except for UNK-280 
 UNK-249 item . the poor lady UNK-57 UNK-273 in a UNK-896 UNK-29 voice 
 with all the UNK-853 UNK-157 of UNK-885 and UNK-993 
 which she believed UNK-256 UNK-916 to her singing . she looked as if she 
 had been UNK-251 from an old UNK-284 and the cheaper parts 
 of the hall made fun of her high UNK-829 notes . the first UNK-228 and the 
 UNK-77 however brought down the house . UNK-464 played a selection 
 of irish UNK-883 which was UNK-114 UNK-737 . the first part closed with 
 a UNK-716 UNK-808 UNK-826 delivered by a young lady who arranged 
 amateur UNK-631 . it was UNK-982 UNK-737 and when it was 
 ended the men went out for the interval content . 
 UNK-0 
 all this time the UNK-902 was a UNK-451 of excitement . in one corner 
 were mr . UNK-106 mr . UNK-486 miss UNK-718 two of the UNK-323 the 
 UNK-232 the bass and mr . UNK-206 burke . mr . UNK-206 burke said it 
 was the most UNK-399 exhibition he had ever UNK-897 . miss UNK-464 
 UNK-67 musical career was ended in dublin after that he said . the 
 UNK-232 was asked what did he think of mrs . UNK-67 conduct . he did 
 not like to say anything . he had been paid his money and UNK-136 to be at 
 peace with men . however he said that mrs . UNK-63 might have taken the 
 UNK-842 into consideration . the UNK-323 and the UNK-806 UNK-983 
 UNK-25 as to what should be done when the interval came . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i agree with miss UNK-718 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-206 burke . UNK-0 " pay her nothing . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 in another corner of the room were mrs . UNK-63 and her husband mr . 
 bell miss UNK-586 and the young lady who had to UNK-754 the UNK-808 
 piece . mrs . UNK-63 said that the committee had treated her 
 UNK-718 . she had UNK-344 neither trouble nor expense and this was 
 how she was UNK-488 . 
 UNK-0 
 they thought they had only a girl to deal with and that therefore they 
 could ride UNK-583 over her . but she would show them their mistake . 
 they UNK-9 have UNK-357 to have treated her like that if she had been a 
 man . but she would see that her daughter got her rights she UNK-9 
 be UNK-906 . if they UNK-3 pay her to the last UNK-407 she would make 
 dublin ring . of course she was sorry for the sake of the UNK-842 . but 
 what else could she do ? she UNK-177 to the second UNK-228 who said he 
 thought she had not been well treated . then she UNK-177 to miss UNK-586 . 
 miss UNK-586 wanted to join the other group but she did not like to do so 
 because she was a great friend of UNK-221 and the UNK-67 had often 
 invited her to their house . 
 UNK-0 
 as soon as the first part was ended mr . UNK-486 and mr . UNK-106 went 
 over to mrs . UNK-63 and told her that the other four UNK-472 would be 
 paid after the committee meeting on the following tuesday and that in 
 case her daughter did not play for the second part the committee would 
 consider the contract broken and would pay nothing . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i UNK-204 seen any committee " UNK-0 said mrs . UNK-63 UNK-551 . UNK-0 " my daughter 
 has her contract . she will get four pounds eight into her hand or a foot 
 she UNK-19 put on that platform . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " im surprised at you mrs . UNK-63 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-106 . UNK-0 " i never thought 
 you would treat us this way . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and what way did you treat me ? " UNK-0 asked mrs . UNK-63 . 
 UNK-0 
 her face was UNK-467 with an angry colour and she looked as if she 
 would attack someone with her hands . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " im asking for my rights . " UNK-0 she said . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " you might have some sense of UNK-224 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-106 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " might i indeed ? . . . and when i ask when my daughter is going to be paid 
 i cant get a civil answer . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she UNK-481 her head and assumed a UNK-706 voice 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " you must speak to the secretary . its not my business . im a great 
 fellow UNK-722 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i thought you were a lady " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-106 walking away from her 
 UNK-740 . 
 UNK-0 
 after that mrs . UNK-67 conduct was UNK-475 on all hands everyone 
 approved of what the committee had done . she stood at the door UNK-845 
 with rage UNK-957 with her husband and daughter UNK-14 with 
 them . she UNK-56 until it was time for the second part to begin in the 
 hope that the UNK-806 would approach her . but miss UNK-586 had UNK-320 
 UNK-332 to play one or two UNK-700 . mrs . UNK-63 had to stand 
 aside to allow the UNK-232 and his UNK-43 to pass up to the 
 platform . she stood still for an instant like an angry stone image 
 and when the first notes of the song struck her ear she caught up her 
 daughters UNK-382 and said to her husband 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " get a cab ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he went out at once . mrs . UNK-63 wrapped the UNK-382 round her daughter 
 and followed him . as she passed through the UNK-102 she stopped and 
 UNK-969 into mr . UNK-396 face . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " im not done with you yet " UNK-0 she said . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but im done with you " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-106 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-464 followed her mother UNK-428 . mr . UNK-106 began to pace up and 
 down the room in order to cool himself for he his skin on fire . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " thats a nice lady ! " UNK-0 he said . UNK-0 " o UNK-23 a nice lady ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " you did the proper thing UNK-106 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-206 burke UNK-834 
 upon his UNK-148 in approval . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 grace 
 UNK-0 
 two UNK-32 who were in the UNK-220 at the time tried to lift him up 
 but he was quite UNK-41 . he lay UNK-827 up at the foot of the UNK-93 
 down which he had fallen . they UNK-427 in turning him over . his hat 
 had rolled a few yards away and his clothes were UNK-320 with the UNK-374 
 and UNK-175 of the floor on which he had UNK-89 face UNK-484 . his eyes 
 were closed and he UNK-98 with a UNK-585 noise . a thin stream of 
 blood UNK-749 from the corner of his mouth . 
 UNK-0 
 these two UNK-32 and one of the UNK-297 carried him up the UNK-93 
 and laid him down again on the floor of the bar . in two minutes he was 
 surrounded by a ring of men . the manager of the bar asked everyone 
 who he was and who was with him . no one knew who he was but one of the 
 UNK-297 said he had served the gentleman with a small UNK-647 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " was he by himself ? " UNK-0 asked the manager . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no sir . there was two UNK-32 with him . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and where are they ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 no one knew a voice said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " give him air . UNK-2 UNK-950 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the ring of UNK-441 UNK-603 and closed again UNK-887 . a dark 
 medal of blood had formed itself near the UNK-54 head on the UNK-789 
 floor . the manager UNK-720 by the grey UNK-917 of the UNK-54 face sent 
 for a UNK-869 . 
 UNK-0 
 his collar was UNK-441 and his UNK-416 UNK-882 . he opened eyes for an 
 instant UNK-279 and closed them again . one of UNK-32 who had carried 
 him UNK-316 held a UNK-460 silk hat in his hand . the manager asked 
 UNK-289 did no one know who the injured man was or where had his 
 friends gone . the door of the bar opened and an UNK-557 UNK-233 
 entered . a crowd which had followed him down the UNK-833 collected 
 outside the door UNK-875 to look in through the glass panels . 
 UNK-0 
 the manager at once began to UNK-911 what he knew . the UNK-233 a young 
 man with thick UNK-34 features UNK-126 . he moved his head slowly to 
 right and left and from the manager to the person on the floor as if 
 he UNK-60 to be the victim of some UNK-316 . then he drew off his UNK-516 
 produced a small book from his UNK-599 UNK-413 the lead of his pencil and 
 made ready to UNK-79 . he asked in a UNK-576 provincial accent 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " who is the man ? whats his name and address ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 a young man in a UNK-268 cleared his way through the ring of 
 UNK-718 . he UNK-97 down promptly beside the injured man and called for 
 water . the UNK-233 UNK-97 down also to help . the young man UNK-466 the 
 blood from the injured UNK-54 mouth and then called for some UNK-957 . the 
 UNK-233 repeated the order in an UNK-818 voice until a UNK-114 
 came running with the glass . the UNK-957 was forced down the UNK-54 
 throat . in a few seconds he opened his eyes and looked about him . he 
 looked at the circle of faces and then understanding UNK-952 to rise to 
 his feet . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-14 all right now ? " UNK-0 asked the young man in the UNK-268 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-491 nothing " UNK-0 said the injured man trying to stand up . 
 UNK-0 
 he was helped to his feet . the manager said something about a hospital 
 and some of the UNK-718 gave advice . the UNK-36 silk hat was placed 
 on the UNK-54 head . the UNK-233 asked 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " where do you live ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the man without answering began to UNK-707 the ends of his UNK-91 . 
 he made light of his accident . it was nothing he said only a little 
 accident . he spoke very UNK-416 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " where do you live ? " UNK-0 repeated the UNK-233 . 
 UNK-0 
 the man said they were to get a cab for him . while the point was being 
 UNK-983 a tall UNK-386 gentleman of fair UNK-691 wearing a long yellow 
 UNK-174 came from the far end of the bar . seeing the UNK-876 he 
 called out 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-123 tom old man ! whats the trouble ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-491 nothing " UNK-0 said the man . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-226 UNK-423 the UNK-302 figure before him and then turned 
 to the UNK-233 saying 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " its all right UNK-233 . ill see him home . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-233 touched his helmet and answered 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " all right mr . power ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " come now tom " UNK-0 said mr . power taking his friend by the arm . UNK-0 " no bones 
 broken . what ? can you walk ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the young man in the UNK-268 took the man by the other arm and the 
 crowd divided . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " how did you get yourself into this mess ? " UNK-0 asked mr . power . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " the gentleman fell down the UNK-93 " UNK-0 said the young man . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i UNK-842 UNK-590 UNK-448 to you sir " UNK-0 said the injured man . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " not at all . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ant we have a little . . . ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " not now . not now . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the three men left the bar and the crowd UNK-96 through the doors in to 
 the UNK-833 . the manager brought the UNK-233 to the UNK-93 to UNK-697 
 the scene of the accident . they agreed that the gentleman must have 
 missed his UNK-842 . the customers returned to the counter and a UNK-114 
 set about removing the UNK-111 of blood from the floor . 
 UNK-0 
 when they came out into UNK-804 street mr . power UNK-250 for an 
 UNK-478 . the injured man said again as well as he could . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i UNK-842 UNK-590 UNK-448 to you sir . i hope well UNK-618 again . y UNK-418 is 
 UNK-16 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the shock and the UNK-424 pain had partly UNK-244 him . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " dont mention it " UNK-0 said the young man . 
 UNK-0 
 they UNK-35 hands . mr . UNK-16 was UNK-605 on to the car and while mr . 
 power was giving directions to the UNK-232 he expressed his UNK-980 
 to the young man and UNK-255 that they could not have a little drink 
 together . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " another time " UNK-0 said the young man . 
 UNK-0 
 the car drove off towards UNK-900 street . as it passed UNK-971 
 office the clock showed UNK-638 nine . a keen east wind hit them 
 blowing from the mouth of the river . mr . UNK-16 was UNK-644 together 
 with cold . his friend asked him to tell how the accident had happened . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-927 an " UNK-0 he answered UNK-0 " y UNK-561 is hurt . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " show . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the other UNK-122 over the well of the car and UNK-427 into mr . UNK-28 
 mouth but he could not see . he struck a match and UNK-275 it in the 
 shell of his hands UNK-427 again into the mouth which mr . UNK-16 opened 
 UNK-95 . the UNK-223 movement of the car brought the match to and 
 from the opened mouth . the lower teeth and UNK-318 were covered with 
 UNK-262 blood and a minute piece of the tongue seemed to have been 
 UNK-696 off . the match was UNK-944 out . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " thats ugly " UNK-0 said mr . power . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-382 s nothing " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-16 closing his mouth and pulling the 
 collar of his UNK-947 coat across his neck . 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-16 was a commercial traveller of the old school which believed 
 in the UNK-491 of its calling . he had never been seen in the city 
 without a silk hat of some UNK-224 and a pair of UNK-509 . by grace of 
 these two articles of clothing he said a man could always pass UNK-828 . 
 he carried on the tradition of his UNK-471 the great UNK-157 whose 
 memory he UNK-685 at times by legend and UNK-376 . modern business methods 
 had UNK-344 him only so far as to allow him a little office in UNK-58 
 street on the window blind of which was written the name of his firm 
 with the UNK-65 e . c . on the UNK-425 of this little office 
 a little UNK-422 UNK-572 of UNK-23 was drawn up and on the table 
 before the window stood four or five china UNK-85 which were usually half 
 full of a black liquid . from these UNK-85 mr . UNK-16 UNK-561 tea . he took 
 a UNK-621 drew it up UNK-897 his UNK-201 with it and then UNK-339 it 
 forth into the UNK-886 . then he UNK-214 to judge . 
 UNK-0 
 mr . power a much younger man was employed in the royal irish 
 UNK-397 office in dublin castle . the arc of his social rise 
 UNK-280 the arc of his friends decline but mr . UNK-28 decline 
 was UNK-423 by the fact that certain of those friends who had known 
 him at his highest point of success still UNK-38 him as a character . 
 mr . power was one of these friends . his UNK-907 UNK-864 were a UNK-110 
 in his circle he was a UNK-160 young man . 
 UNK-0 
 the car UNK-46 before a small house on the UNK-503 road and mr . UNK-16 
 was helped into the house . his wife put him to bed while mr . power sat 
 UNK-627 in the kitchen asking the children where they went to school 
 and what book they were in . the UNK-672 girls and a boy conscious 
 of their fathers UNK-274 and of their mothers absence began some 
 UNK-329 with him . he was surprised at their UNK-347 and at their 
 UNK-122 and his UNK-195 grew UNK-198 . after a while mrs . UNK-16 entered 
 the kitchen UNK-963 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " such a sight ! o hell do for himself one day and thats the holy UNK-508 
 of it . UNK-2 been drinking since friday . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . power was careful to explain to her that he was not responsible 
 that he had come on the scene by the UNK-761 accident . mrs . UNK-16 
 UNK-617 mr . powers good offices during domestic UNK-714 as well 
 as many small but UNK-399 loans said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o you UNK-449 tell me that mr . power . i know UNK-14 a friend of his 
 not like some of the others he does be with . UNK-30 all right so long 
 as he has money in his pocket to keep him out from his wife and family . 
 nice friends ! who was he with tonight id like to know ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . power UNK-35 his head but said nothing . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " im so sorry " UNK-0 she continued UNK-0 " that UNK-201 nothing in the house to offer 
 you . but if you wait a minute ill send round to UNK-498 at the 
 corner . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . power stood up . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " we were waiting for him to come home with the money . he never seems to 
 think he has a home at all . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o now mrs . UNK-16 " UNK-0 said mr . power UNK-0 " well make him turn over a new 
 leaf . ill talk to martin . UNK-2 the man . well come here one of these 
 nights and talk it over . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she saw him to the door . the UNK-232 was UNK-349 up and down the 
 UNK-125 and UNK-907 his arms to warm himself . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " its very kind of you to bring him home " UNK-0 she said . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " not at all " UNK-0 said mr . power . 
 UNK-0 
 he got up on the car . as it drove off he raised his hat to her UNK-219 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well make a new man of him " UNK-0 he said . UNK-0 " UNK-274 mrs . UNK-16 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mrs . UNK-28 UNK-555 eyes watched the car till it was out of sight . 
 then she UNK-740 them went into the house and UNK-198 her UNK-624 
 pockets . 
 UNK-0 
 she was an active practical woman of middle age . not long before she 
 had UNK-415 her silver wedding and UNK-201 her UNK-609 with her 
 husband by UNK-317 with him to mr . powers UNK-621 . in her days 
 of UNK-345 mr . UNK-16 had seemed to her a not UNK-264 figure and 
 she still UNK-569 to the chapel door whenever a wedding was reported 
 and seeing the bridal pair UNK-225 with UNK-606 pleasure how she had 
 passed out of the star of the sea church in UNK-476 UNK-200 on the 
 arm of a UNK-32 UNK-25 man who was dressed UNK-462 in a UNK-423 
 and UNK-534 UNK-48 and carried a silk hat UNK-813 balanced upon 
 his other arm . after three weeks she had found a UNK-522 life UNK-144 
 and later on when she was beginning to find it UNK-101 she had 
 become a mother . the part of mother presented to her no UNK-506 
 difficulties and for UNK-48 years she had kept house UNK-569 for 
 her husband . her two UNK-904 sons were launched . one was in a UNK-238 
 shop in glasgow and the other was clerk to a UNK-57 in belfast . 
 they were good sons wrote regularly and sometimes sent home money . the 
 other children were still at school . 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-16 sent a letter to his office next day and remained in bed . she 
 made UNK-721 for him and UNK-184 him UNK-937 . she accepted his frequent 
 UNK-59 as part of the climate UNK-985 him UNK-902 whenever he 
 was sick and always tried to make him eat a breakfast . there were worse 
 UNK-624 . he had never been violent since the boys had grown up and she 
 knew that he would walk to the end of thomas street and back again to 
 book even a small order . 
 UNK-0 
 two nights after his friends came to see him . she brought them up to 
 his bedroom the air of which was UNK-488 with a personal UNK-143 
 and gave them chairs at the fire . mr . UNK-28 tongue the occasional 
 UNK-358 pain of which had made him somewhat UNK-384 during the day 
 became more UNK-727 . he sat UNK-973 up in the bed by UNK-182 and the 
 little colour in his UNK-266 UNK-145 made them UNK-391 warm UNK-186 . he 
 UNK-872 to his guests for the disorder of the room but at the same 
 time looked at them a little proudly with a veterans pride . 
 UNK-0 
 he was quite UNK-225 that he was the victim of a plot which his 
 friends mr . UNK-11 mr . UNK-37 and mr . power had UNK-634 to mrs . 
 UNK-16 in the UNK-309 . the idea had been mr . powers but its development 
 was UNK-541 to mr . UNK-11 . mr . UNK-16 came of UNK-560 stock 
 and though he had been converted to the catholic faith at the time 
 of his marriage he had not been in the pale of the church for twenty 
 years . he was UNK-345 moreover of giving UNK-854 at UNK-877 . 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-11 was the very man for such a case . he was an elder 
 colleague of mr . power . his own domestic life was not very happy . people 
 had great sympathy with him for it was known that he had married an 
 UNK-525 woman who was an UNK-711 UNK-27 . he had set up house 
 for her six times and each time she had UNK-173 the furniture on him . 
 UNK-0 
 everyone had respect for poor martin UNK-11 . he was a thoroughly 
 UNK-629 man UNK-902 and intelligent . his blade of human knowledge 
 natural UNK-147 UNK-315 by long association with cases in the 
 police courts had been UNK-711 by brief UNK-982 in the waters 
 of general philosophy . he was well informed . his friends UNK-170 to his 
 opinions and considered that his face was like UNK-892 . 
 UNK-0 
 when the plot had been UNK-634 to her mrs . UNK-16 had said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i leave it all in your hands mr . UNK-11 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 after a quarter of a century of married life she had very few UNK-476 
 left . religion for her was a UNK-158 and she suspected that a man of her 
 UNK-624 age would not change greatly before death . she was UNK-508 to 
 see a curious UNK-368 in his accident and but that she did 
 not wish to seem UNK-965 would have told the UNK-32 that 
 mr . UNK-28 tongue would not suffer by being UNK-590 . however mr . 
 UNK-11 was a capable man and religion was religion . the scheme 
 might do good and at least it could do no harm . her beliefs were 
 not UNK-950 . she believed UNK-943 in the sacred heart as the 
 most generally useful of all catholic UNK-975 and approved of the 
 UNK-598 . her faith was UNK-885 by her kitchen but if she was put to 
 it she could believe also in the UNK-798 and in the holy ghost . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-32 began to talk of the accident . mr . UNK-11 said that he 
 had once known a similar case . a man of UNK-685 had UNK-696 off a piece 
 of his tongue during an UNK-918 fit and the tongue had filled in 
 again so that no one could see a trace of the bite . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well im not UNK-685 " UNK-0 said the invalid . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " god UNK-1 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " it UNK-55 pain you now ? " UNK-0 asked mr . UNK-37 . 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-37 had been at one time a UNK-228 of some reputation . his wife who 
 had been a UNK-920 still taught young children to play the piano at low 
 terms . his line of life had not been the UNK-795 distance between two 
 points and for short periods he had been driven to live by his UNK-115 . he 
 had been a clerk in the UNK-356 railway a UNK-532 for advertisements 
 for the irish times and for the UNK-920 journal a town traveller 
 for a coal firm on commission a private inquiry agent a clerk in the 
 office of the UNK-181 and he had recently become secretary to the 
 city UNK-375 . his new office made him UNK-98 interested in mr . 
 UNK-28 case . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " pain ? not much " UNK-0 answered mr . UNK-16 . UNK-0 " but its so UNK-434 . i feel as 
 if i wanted to UNK-748 off . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " thats the UNK-118 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 UNK-419 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-16 . UNK-0 " i think i caught a cold on the car . UNK-6 
 something keeps coming into my throat UNK-212 or " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-893 . " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-37 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " it keeps coming like from down in my throat UNK-434 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes yes " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-37 UNK-0 " thats the UNK-911 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he looked at mr . UNK-11 and mr . power at the same time with an air 
 of challenge . mr . UNK-11 UNK-146 his head rapidly and mr . power said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ah well UNK-508 well that ends well . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " im very much UNK-499 to you old man " UNK-0 said the invalid . 
 UNK-0 
 mr . power UNK-234 his hand . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " those other two UNK-13 i was with " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " who were you with ? " UNK-0 asked mr . UNK-11 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " a UNK-26 . i dont know his name . damn it now whats his name ? little 
 UNK-26 with sandy hair . . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and who else ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-393 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-723 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 . 
 UNK-0 
 when mr . UNK-11 made that remark people were silent . it was known 
 that the speaker had secret sources of information . in this case the 
 UNK-915 had a moral intention . mr . UNK-393 sometimes formed one 
 of a little UNK-206 which left the city shortly after noon on sunday 
 with the purpose of UNK-44 as soon as possible at some UNK-722 on 
 the UNK-316 of the city where its members UNK-816 qualified themselves as 
 UNK-701 UNK-305 UNK-338 . but his UNK-982 had never UNK-332 
 to UNK-195 his origin . he had begun life as an UNK-960 UNK-827 by 
 lending small UNK-994 of money to UNK-166 at UNK-837 interest . later on he 
 had become the partner of a very fat short gentleman mr . UNK-410 in 
 the UNK-564 loan bank . though he had never UNK-448 more than the jewish 
 ethical code his UNK-523 whenever they had UNK-869 in person 
 or by proxy under his UNK-188 spoke of him UNK-828 as an irish UNK-181 
 and an UNK-169 and saw divine UNK-297 of UNK-783 made UNK-524 
 through the person of his UNK-818 son . at other times they remembered his 
 good points . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i wonder where did he go to " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-16 . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-136 the details of the incident to remain UNK-209 . he UNK-136 his 
 friends to think there had been some mistake that mr . UNK-393 and he 
 had missed each other . his friends who knew quite well mr . UNK-123 
 UNK-347 in drinking were silent . mr . power said again 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-508 well that ends well . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-16 changed the subject at once . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " that was a decent young UNK-26 that medical fellow " UNK-0 he said . UNK-0 " only for 
 him " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o only for him " UNK-0 said mr . power UNK-0 " it might have been a case of seven 
 days without the option of a fine . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes yes " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-16 trying to remember . UNK-0 " i remember now there 
 was a UNK-869 . decent young fellow he seemed . how did it happen at 
 all ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " it happened that you were UNK-646 tom " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 
 UNK-141 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " true bill " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-16 equally UNK-141 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i suppose you UNK-931 the UNK-233 jack " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-37 . 
 UNK-0 
 mr . power did not UNK-238 the use of his christian name . he was not 
 UNK-399 but he could not forget that mr . UNK-37 had recently made 
 a UNK-175 in search of UNK-12 and UNK-215 to enable mrs . UNK-37 to 
 UNK-722 UNK-461 UNK-538 in the country . more than he UNK-77 the 
 fact that he had been UNK-842 he UNK-77 such low playing of the 
 game . he answered the question therefore as if mr . UNK-16 had asked 
 it . 
 UNK-0 
 the narrative made mr . UNK-16 UNK-94 . he was UNK-345 conscious of his 
 citizenship UNK-136 to live with his city on terms UNK-606 UNK-176 
 and UNK-77 any UNK-134 put upon him by those whom he called country 
 UNK-223 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " is this what we pay rates for ? " UNK-0 he asked . UNK-0 " to feed and UNK-71 these 
 UNK-814 UNK-172 . . . and UNK-30 nothing else . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-11 UNK-20 . he was a castle official only during office 
 hours . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " how could they be anything else tom ? " UNK-0 he said . 
 UNK-0 
 he assumed a thick provincial accent and said in a tone of command 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-70 catch your UNK-388 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 everyone UNK-20 . mr . UNK-37 who wanted to enter the conversation by any 
 door UNK-204 that he had never heard the story . mr . UNK-11 said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " it is UNK-190 say you UNK-538 take place in the depot where 
 they get these UNK-191 big country UNK-13 UNK-313 you know to 
 drill . the UNK-616 makes them stand in a row against the wall and hold 
 up their plates . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he illustrated the story by UNK-16 UNK-746 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " at dinner you know . then he has a bloody big bowl of UNK-388 before 
 him on the table and a bloody big UNK-62 like a UNK-286 . he takes up a UNK-499 
 of UNK-388 on the UNK-62 and UNK-419 it across the room and the poor UNK-268 
 have to try and catch it on their plates UNK-70 catch your UNK-388 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 everyone UNK-20 again but mr . UNK-16 was somewhat UNK-94 still . he 
 talked of writing a letter to the papers . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " these UNK-81 coming up here " UNK-0 he said UNK-0 " think they can boss the people . 
 i UNK-449 tell you martin what kind of men they are . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-11 gave a qualified UNK-338 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " its like everything else in this world " UNK-0 he said . UNK-0 " you get some bad 
 ones and you get some good ones . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o yes you get some good ones i admit " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-16 satisfied . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " its better to have nothing to say to them " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-37 . UNK-0 " thats my 
 opinion ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mrs . UNK-16 entered the room and placing a tray on the table said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " help UNK-662 UNK-32 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . power stood up to UNK-654 offering her his chair . she declined 
 it saying she was UNK-501 UNK-627 and after having UNK-45 a UNK-104 
 with mr . UNK-11 behind mr . powers back prepared to leave the room . 
 her husband called out to her 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and have you nothing for me UNK-77 ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o you ! the back of my hand to you ! " UNK-0 said mrs . UNK-16 UNK-169 . 
 UNK-0 
 her husband called after her 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " nothing for poor little UNK-573 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he assumed such a UNK-558 face and voice that the distribution of the 
 bottles of UNK-98 took place UNK-22 general UNK-95 . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-32 UNK-59 from their glasses set the glasses again on the 
 table and UNK-214 . then mr . UNK-11 turned towards mr . power and said 
 UNK-59 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " on thursday night you said jack . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " thursday yes " UNK-0 said mr . power . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-988 ! " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 promptly . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " we can meet in UNK-549 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-37 . UNK-0 " UNK-397 be the most 
 convenient place . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but we UNK-610 be late " UNK-0 said mr . power UNK-519 UNK-0 " because it is sure 
 to be UNK-816 to the doors . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " we can meet at UNK-786 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-37 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-988 ! " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-786 at UNK-549 be it ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 there was a short silence . mr . UNK-16 UNK-56 to see whether he would be 
 taken into his friends confidence . then he asked 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " whats in the wind ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o its nothing " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 . UNK-0 " its only a little matter that 
 were UNK-316 about for thursday . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " the opera is it ? " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-16 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no no " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 in an UNK-46 tone UNK-0 " its just a little . . . 
 spiritual matter . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-16 . 
 UNK-0 
 there was silence again . then mr . power said point blank 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " to tell you the truth tom were going to make a retreat . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes thats it " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 UNK-0 " jack and i and UNK-37 UNK-500 
 all going to wash the pot . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-420 the UNK-246 with a certain UNK-393 energy and encouraged by 
 his own voice UNK-360 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " you see we may as well all admit were a nice collection of 
 UNK-703 one and all . i say one and all " UNK-0 he added with UNK-359 
 charity and turning to mr . power . UNK-0 " own up now ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i own up " UNK-0 said mr . power . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and i own up " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-37 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " so were going to wash the pot together " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 . 
 UNK-0 
 a thought seemed to strike him . he turned suddenly to the invalid and 
 said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-524 know what tom has just occurred to me ? you night join in and 
 wed have a UNK-876 reel . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " good idea " UNK-0 said mr . power . UNK-0 " the four of us together . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-16 was silent . the proposal UNK-465 very little meaning to 
 his mind but understanding that some spiritual agencies were about to 
 concern themselves on his behalf he thought he UNK-998 it to his UNK-491 
 to show a UNK-257 neck . he took no part in the conversation for a long 
 while but UNK-126 with an air of calm UNK-692 while his friends 
 discussed the UNK-517 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i UNK-204 such a bad opinion of the UNK-517 " UNK-0 he said UNK-661 at 
 length . UNK-0 " UNK-30 an educated order . i believe they mean well too . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-30 the UNK-162 order in the church tom " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 
 with UNK-311 . UNK-0 " the general of the UNK-517 stands next to the pope . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-6 no mistake about it " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-37 UNK-0 " if you want a thing 
 well done and no UNK-714 about you go to a UNK-249 . UNK-30 the UNK-925 have 
 influence . ill tell you a case in point . . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " the UNK-517 are a fine body of men " UNK-0 said mr . power . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " its a curious thing " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 UNK-0 " about the UNK-249 order . 
 every other order of the church had to be UNK-439 at some time or other 
 but the UNK-249 order was never once UNK-439 . it never fell away . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " is that so ? " UNK-0 asked mr . UNK-37 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " thats a fact " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 . UNK-0 " thats history . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " look at their church too " UNK-0 said mr . power . UNK-0 " look at the UNK-197 
 they have . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " the UNK-517 UNK-560 for the upper classes " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-37 . 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-30 all good men " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 UNK-0 " each in his own way . the 
 irish UNK-117 is UNK-1 all the world over . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o yes " UNK-0 said mr . power . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " not like some of the other UNK-257 on the continent " UNK-0 said mr . 
 UNK-37 UNK-0 " UNK-150 of the name . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " perhaps UNK-14 right " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-16 UNK-728 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " of course im right " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 . UNK-0 " i UNK-204 been in the 
 world all this time and seen most sides of it without being a judge of 
 character . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-32 UNK-59 again one following UNK-69 example . mr . UNK-16 
 seemed to be UNK-902 something in his mind . he was impressed . he had a 
 high opinion of mr . UNK-11 as a judge of character and as a reader 
 of faces . he asked for UNK-803 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o its just a retreat you know " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 . UNK-0 " father UNK-359

 UNK-0 " o you must know him tom " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 UNK-147 . UNK-0 " fine UNK-236

 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-209 . . . . its not exactly a UNK-566 you know . its just kind of a 
 friendly talk you know in a UNK-85 way . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-16 UNK-326 . mr . UNK-37 said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " father tom burke that was the boy ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o father tom burke " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 UNK-0 " that was a born UNK-241 . did

 him . . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and yet they say he UNK-69 much of a UNK-667 " UNK-0 said mr UNK-11 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " is that so ? " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-37 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o of course nothing wrong you know . only sometimes they say he 
 UNK-3 UNK-867 what was quite UNK-40 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ah ! . . . he was a UNK-288 man " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-37 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i heard him once " UNK-0 mr . UNK-16 continued . UNK-0 " i forget the subject of his 
 UNK-649 now . UNK-250 and i were in the back of the . . . pit you know . . . 
 the " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " the body " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes in the back near the door . i forget now what . . . . o yes it was 
 on the pope the late pope . i remember it well . upon my word it was 
 magnificent the style of the UNK-771 . and his voice ! god ! UNK-180 he a 
 voice ! the prisoner of the vatican he called him . i remember UNK-250 
 saying to me when we came out " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but UNK-2 an UNK-280 UNK-250 UNK-50 he ? " UNK-0 said mr . power . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " course he is " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-16 UNK-0 " and a UNK-100 decent UNK-280 too . we

 the gods UNK-382 i remember well his very words . UNK-16 he said we 
 worship at different UNK-452 he said but our belief is the same . struck 
 me as very well put . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-6 a good deal in that " UNK-0 said mr . power . UNK-0 " there used always to be 
 UNK-291 of UNK-949 in the chapel where father tom was UNK-294 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-6 not much difference between us " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-37 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " we both believe in " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-767 for a moment . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-0 . . . in the UNK-890 . only they dont believe in the pope and in the 
 mother of god . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but of course " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 UNK-40 and effectively UNK-0 " our 
 religion is the religion the old original faith . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " not a doubt of it " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-16 UNK-807 . 
 UNK-0 
 mrs . UNK-16 came to the door of the bedroom and announced 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-182 a visitor for you ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " who is it ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " mr . UNK-530 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o come in ! come in ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 a pale oval face came forward into the light . the arch of its fair 
 UNK-184 UNK-91 was repeated in the fair UNK-993 UNK-759 above 
 UNK-477 UNK-647 eyes . mr . UNK-530 was a UNK-511 UNK-618 . he had 
 failed in business in a licensed house in the city because his financial 
 condition had UNK-433 him to tie himself to UNK-762 UNK-945 
 and UNK-639 . he had opened a small shop on UNK-503 road where he 
 UNK-160 himself his UNK-347 would UNK-765 him with the housewives 
 of the district . he UNK-135 himself with a certain grace UNK-948 
 little children and spoke with a UNK-522 UNK-292 . he was not without 
 culture . 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-530 brought a gift with him a UNK-265 of special UNK-224 . he 
 UNK-388 UNK-269 for mr . UNK-16 placed his gift on the table and sat 
 down with the company on equal terms . mr . UNK-16 appreciated the gift 
 all the more since he was aware that there was a small account for 
 UNK-242 UNK-61 between him and mr . UNK-530 . he said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i UNK-9 doubt you old man . open that jack will you ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . power again UNK-42 . glasses were UNK-311 and five small 
 measures of UNK-224 were UNK-207 out . this new influence UNK-722 the 
 conversation . mr . UNK-530 sitting on a small area of the chair was 
 specially interested . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " pope leo UNK-48 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 UNK-0 " was one of the lights of the age . 
 his great idea you know was the union of the latin and greek churches . 
 that was the aim of his life . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i often heard he was one of the most intellectual men in europe " UNK-0 said 
 mr . power . UNK-0 " i mean apart from his being pope . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " so he was " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 UNK-0 " if not the most so . his UNK-595 you 
 know as pope was UNK-1 upon UNK-407 upon light . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no no " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-530 UNK-433 . UNK-0 " i think UNK-14 wrong there . it was 
 UNK-1 in UNK-747 i UNK-213 in darkness . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o yes " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-37 UNK-0 " UNK-331 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " allow me " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 UNK-255 UNK-0 " it was UNK-1 upon UNK-1 . and 
 UNK-245 ix his UNK-529 UNK-595 was UNK-864 upon UNK-233 is cross upon 
 UNK-569 show the difference between their two UNK-777 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-3 was allowed . mr . UNK-11 continued . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " pope leo you know was a great scholar and a poet . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " he had a strong face " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-16 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 . UNK-0 " he wrote latin poetry . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " is that so ? " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-530 . 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-37 UNK-561 his UNK-224 UNK-453 and UNK-35 his head with a double 
 intention saying 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " thats no joke i can tell you . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " we UNK-3 learn that tom " UNK-0 said mr . power following mr . UNK-199 
 example UNK-0 " when we went to the UNK-293 school . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " there was many a good man went to the UNK-293 school with a UNK-518 
 of UNK-474 under his UNK-969 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-16 UNK-446 . UNK-0 " the old system 
 was the best plain honest education . none of your modern UNK-320 . . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " quite right " UNK-0 said mr . power . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no UNK-352 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-530 . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-857 the word and then UNK-59 UNK-141 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i remember reading " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 UNK-0 " that one of pope UNK-620 poems 
 was on the invention of the UNK-914 latin of course . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " on the photograph ! " UNK-0 UNK-751 mr . UNK-16 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 . 
 UNK-0 
 he also UNK-59 from his glass . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well you know " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-37 UNK-0 " UNK-50 the photograph wonderful when 
 you come to think of it ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o of course " UNK-0 said mr . power UNK-0 " great minds can see things . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " as the poet says great minds are very near to madness " UNK-0 said mr . 
 UNK-530 . 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-16 seemed to be UNK-371 in mind . he made an effort to recall 
 the UNK-560 theology on some UNK-978 points and in the end addressed 
 mr . UNK-11 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " tell me martin " UNK-0 he said . UNK-0 " UNK-265 some of the UNK-848 course not 
 our present man or his UNK-642 but some of the old UNK-254 
 exactly . . . you know . . . up to the UNK-515 ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 there was a silence . mr . UNK-11 said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o of course there were some bad lots . . . but the UNK-303 thing 
 is this . not one of them not the biggest UNK-27 not the most . . . 
 UNK-891 UNK-17 not one of them ever UNK-782 ex UNK-167 a word of 
 false doctrine . now UNK-50 that an UNK-303 thing ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " that is " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-16 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes because when the pope speaks ex UNK-167 " UNK-0 mr . UNK-530 explained 
 UNK-0 " he is UNK-885 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o i know about the UNK-974 of the pope . i remember i was younger 
 then . . . . or was it that ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-530 UNK-9 . he took up the bottle and helped the others to 
 a little more . mr . UNK-37 seeing that there was not enough to go round 
 UNK-162 that he had not finished his first measure . the others accepted 
 under protest . the light music of UNK-224 falling into glasses made an 
 UNK-768 UNK-175 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " whats that you were saying tom ? " UNK-0 asked mr . UNK-37 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-815 UNK-974 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 UNK-0 " that was the greatest scene 
 in the whole history of the church . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " how was that martin ? " UNK-0 asked mr . power . 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-11 held up two thick fingers . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " in the sacred college you know of UNK-775 and UNK-367 and 
 UNK-910 there were two men who held out against it while the others were 
 all for it . the whole UNK-367 except these two was UNK-420 . no ! they 
 UNK-9 have it ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ha ! " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-37 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and they were a german UNK-788 by the name of UNK-472 . . . or UNK-557 . . . 
 or " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-557 was no german and thats a sure five " UNK-0 said mr . power 
 laughing . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well this great german UNK-788 whatever his name was was one and 
 the other was john UNK-692 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what ? " UNK-0 UNK-5 mr . UNK-16 . UNK-0 " is it john of UNK-928 ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " are you sure of that now ? " UNK-0 asked mr . UNK-530 UNK-644 . UNK-0 " i thought it 
 was some italian or american . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " john of UNK-928 " UNK-0 repeated mr . UNK-11 UNK-0 " was the man . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-59 and the other UNK-32 followed his lead . then he UNK-604 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " there they were at it all the UNK-775 and UNK-910 and UNK-367 
 from all the ends of the earth and these two fighting dog and devil 
 until at last the pope himself stood up and declared UNK-974 a 
 UNK-351 of the church ex UNK-167 . on the very moment john UNK-692 who 
 had been UNK-957 and UNK-957 against it stood up and UNK-247 out with 
 the voice of a lion UNK-391 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i believe ! " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-530 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-391 ! " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 . UNK-0 " that showed the faith he had . he submitted 
 the moment the pope spoke . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and what about UNK-557 ? " UNK-0 asked mr . UNK-37 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " the german UNK-788 UNK-9 submit . he left the church . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-917 words had built up the vast image of the church in the 
 minds of his UNK-614 . his deep UNK-957 voice had UNK-892 them as it 
 UNK-420 the word of belief and submission . when mrs . UNK-16 came into 
 the room UNK-980 her hands she came into a UNK-384 company . she did not 
 UNK-821 the silence but UNK-122 over the rail at the foot of the bed . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i once saw john UNK-692 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-16 UNK-0 " and ill never forget it as 
 long as i live . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he turned towards his wife to be confirmed . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i often told you that ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mrs . UNK-16 UNK-146 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " it was at the UNK-959 of sir john UNK-570 UNK-287 . UNK-819 UNK-495 
 gray was speaking UNK-259 away and here was this old fellow 
 UNK-998 old UNK-26 looking at him from under his UNK-508 UNK-993 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-16 UNK-756 his UNK-490 and UNK-314 his head like an angry bull 
 UNK-969 at his wife . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " god ! " UNK-0 he UNK-751 UNK-535 his natural face UNK-0 " i never saw such an eye 
 in a UNK-54 head . it was as much as to say i have you properly UNK-162 my 
 UNK-5 . he had an eye like a hawk . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " none of the UNK-570 was any good " UNK-0 said mr . power . 
 UNK-0 
 there was a UNK-242 again . mr . power turned to mrs . UNK-16 and said with 
 UNK-52 UNK-195 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well mrs . UNK-16 were going to make your man here a good holy UNK-290 
 and UNK-744 roman catholic . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-716 his arm round the company UNK-259 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " were all going to make a retreat together and UNK-313 our UNK-256 
 god knows we want it badly . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i dont mind " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-16 UNK-21 a little UNK-409 . 
 UNK-0 
 mrs . UNK-16 thought it would be UNK-367 to UNK-693 her satisfaction . so 
 she said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i UNK-47 the poor priest that has to listen to your tale . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-28 expression changed . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " if he UNK-55 like it " UNK-0 he said UNK-770 UNK-0 " he can . . . do the other thing . 
 ill just tell him my little tale of UNK-726 . im not such a bad fellow " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-11 UNK-575 promptly . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well all UNK-705 the devil " UNK-0 he said UNK-0 " together not UNK-779 his 
 works and UNK-536 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " get behind me UNK-445 ! " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-530 laughing and looking at the 
 others . 
 UNK-0 
 mr . power said nothing . he felt completely UNK-956 . but a pleased 
 expression UNK-254 across his face . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " all we have to do " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 UNK-0 " is to stand up with UNK-340 
 candles in our hands and renew our UNK-783 UNK-805 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o dont forget the candle tom " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-37 UNK-0 " whatever you do . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what ? " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-16 . UNK-0 " must i have a candle ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o yes " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-11 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no damn it all " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-16 UNK-220 UNK-0 " i draw the line there . 
 ill do the job right enough . ill do the retreat business and 
 UNK-343 and . . . all that business . but . . . no candles ! no damn it 
 all i bar the candles ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-35 his head with UNK-581 gravity . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " listen to that ! " UNK-0 said his wife . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i bar the candles " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-16 conscious of having created an 
 effect on his audience and continuing to shake his head to and UNK-161 . UNK-0 " i 
 bar the UNK-980 business . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 everyone UNK-20 UNK-496 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-6 a nice catholic for you ! " UNK-0 said his wife . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no candles ! " UNK-0 repeated mr . UNK-16 UNK-965 . UNK-0 " thats off ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-580 of the UNK-249 church in UNK-914 street was almost full 
 and still at every moment UNK-32 entered from the side door and 
 directed by the UNK-921 walked on UNK-649 along the UNK-874 until 
 they found seating accommodation . the UNK-32 were all well dressed 
 and UNK-656 . the light of the lamps of the church fell upon an assembly 
 of black clothes and white UNK-184 UNK-361 here and there by UNK-760 
 on dark UNK-201 UNK-552 of green marble and on UNK-542 UNK-113 . the 
 UNK-32 sat in the UNK-674 having UNK-402 their UNK-48 slightly 
 above their UNK-111 and laid their hats in security . they sat well back 
 and UNK-84 UNK-533 at the distant UNK-531 of red light which was suspended 
 before the high UNK-92 .

 in one of the UNK-674 near the UNK-544 sat mr . UNK-11 and mr . UNK-16 . 
 in the bench behind sat mr . UNK-37 alone and in the bench behind him sat 
 mr . power and mr . UNK-530 . mr . UNK-37 had tried UNK-29 to find a 
 place in the bench with the others and when the party had settled down 
 in the form of a UNK-697 he had tried UNK-29 to make comic 
 remarks . as these had not been well received he had UNK-713 . even he 
 was UNK-629 of the UNK-152 atmosphere and even he began to respond to 
 the religious UNK-301 . in a UNK-365 mr . UNK-11 drew mr . UNK-28 
 attention to mr . UNK-393 the UNK-956 who sat some distance off 
 and to mr . UNK-463 the registration agent and mayor maker of the city 
 who was sitting immediately under the UNK-544 beside one of the newly 
 elected UNK-796 of the ward . to the right sat old michael UNK-895 
 the owner of three UNK-623 shops and dan UNK-832 UNK-401 who was 
 up for the job in the town UNK-653 office . UNK-199 in front sat 
 mr . UNK-112 the chief reporter of the UNK-920 journal and poor 
 UNK-130 an old friend of mr . UNK-28 who had been at one time a 
 considerable commercial figure . gradually as he recognised familiar 
 faces mr . UNK-16 began to feel more at home . his hat which had been 
 UNK-890 by his wife UNK-346 upon his UNK-111 . once or twice he 
 pulled down his UNK-625 with one hand while he held the UNK-233 of his hat 
 UNK-79 but UNK-419 with the other hand . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-204 figure the upper part of which was UNK-658 with 
 a white UNK-348 was observed to be UNK-875 into the UNK-544 . 
 simultaneously the UNK-197 UNK-61 produced UNK-165 and 
 UNK-97 upon them with care . mr . UNK-16 followed the general example . the 
 UNK-73 figure now stood UNK-539 in the UNK-544 UNK-795 of its bulk 
 UNK-818 by a massive red face appearing above the UNK-138 . 
 UNK-0 
 father UNK-359 UNK-97 down turned towards the red UNK-531 of light 
 and covering his face with his hands UNK-124 . after an interval he 
 UNK-300 his face and rose . the UNK-197 rose also and settled 
 again on its UNK-674 . mr . UNK-16 restored his hat to its original 
 position on his knee and presented an UNK-308 face to the UNK-530 . 
 the UNK-530 turned back each wide sleeve of his UNK-348 with an 
 UNK-896 large UNK-359 and slowly UNK-423 the array of faces . then he 
 said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " for the children of this world are UNK-367 in their generation than the 
 children of light . UNK-977 make unto UNK-662 friends out of the 
 UNK-412 of UNK-438 so that when you die they may receive you into 
 UNK-417 UNK-630 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 father UNK-359 developed the text with UNK-953 assurance . it was one of 
 the most difficult texts in all the UNK-957 he said to UNK-990 
 properly . it was a text which might seem to the casual observer at 
 variance with the UNK-173 UNK-83 elsewhere UNK-782 by jesus christ . 
 but he told his UNK-614 the text had seemed to him specially adapted 
 for the guidance of those whose lot it was to lead the life of the world 
 and who yet UNK-136 to lead that life not in the manner of UNK-224 . it 
 was a text for business men and professional men . jesus christ with his 
 divine understanding of every UNK-103 of our human nature understood 
 that all men were not called to the religious life that by far the vast 
 majority were forced to live in the world and to a certain extent 
 for the world and in this sentence he designed to give them a word of 
 counsel setting before them as UNK-599 in the religious life those 
 very UNK-903 of UNK-412 who were of all men the least UNK-840 in 
 matters religious . 
 UNK-0 
 he told his UNK-614 that he was there that evening for no UNK-934 
 no UNK-950 purpose but as a man of the world speaking to his 
 UNK-142 . he came to speak to business men and he would speak to them 
 in a UNK-864 way . if he might use the UNK-246 he said he was 
 their spiritual UNK-829 and he UNK-136 each and every one of his 
 UNK-614 to open his books the books of his spiritual life and see if 
 they UNK-281 accurately with UNK-212 . 
 UNK-0 
 jesus christ was not a hard UNK-340 . he understood our little 
 UNK-524 understood the UNK-688 of our poor fallen nature understood 
 the UNK-924 of this life . we might have had we all had from time to 
 time our UNK-924 we might have we all had our UNK-524 . but one 
 thing only he said he would ask of his UNK-614 . and that was to be 
 straight and UNK-306 with god . if their accounts UNK-281 in every point to 
 say 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well i have verified my accounts . i find all well . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 but if as might happen there were some UNK-245 to admit the 
 truth to be frank and say like a man 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well i have looked into my accounts . i find this wrong and this wrong . 
 but with gods grace i will UNK-267 this and this . i will set right my 
 accounts . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0

 UNK-246 the UNK-555 daughter was literally run off her feet . hardly 
 had she brought one gentleman into the little UNK-734 behind the office 
 on the ground floor and helped him off with his UNK-319 than the UNK-667 
 UNK-581 bell UNK-378 again and she had to UNK-649 along the bare 
 UNK-996 to let in another guest . it was well for her she had not to 
 attend to the ladies also . but miss kate and miss julia had thought 
 of that and had converted the bathroom UNK-316 into a ladies 
 UNK-902 . miss kate and miss julia were there UNK-142 and 
 laughing and UNK-99 walking after each other to the head of the 
 UNK-93 UNK-639 down over the UNK-442 and calling down to UNK-246 to ask 
 her who had come . 
 UNK-0 
 it was always a great affair the UNK-65 UNK-571 annual dance . 
 everybody who knew them came to it members of the family old friends 
 of the family the members of UNK-468 choir any of UNK-561 pupils that 
 were grown up enough and even some of mary UNK-352 pupils too . never 
 once had it fallen flat . for years and years it had gone off in UNK-288 
 style as long as anyone could remember ever since kate and julia 
 after the death of their brother pat had left the house in UNK-636 
 UNK-898 and taken mary jane their only UNK-349 to live with them in the 
 dark UNK-421 house on UNK-332 island the upper part of which they had 
 UNK-902 from mr . UNK-82 the UNK-969 on the ground floor . that was a 
 good thirty years ago if it was a day . mary jane who was then a little 
 girl in short clothes was now the main UNK-665 of the household for she 
 had the organ in UNK-592 road . she had been through the academy 
 and gave a pupils concert every year in the upper room of the UNK-315 
 concert rooms . many of her pupils UNK-386 to the UNK-998 families 
 on the UNK-894 and UNK-54 line . old as they were her UNK-37 also did 
 their share . julia though she was quite grey was still the leading 
 UNK-920 in adam and UNK-386 and kate being too UNK-879 to go about much 
 gave music lessons to beginners on the old square piano in the back 
 room . UNK-246 the UNK-555 daughter did UNK-847 work for them . 
 though their life was UNK-511 they believed in eating well the best 
 of everything UNK-969 UNK-363 UNK-932 tea and the best 
 UNK-664 UNK-98 . but UNK-246 UNK-566 made a mistake in the orders so that she 
 got on well with her three UNK-884 . they were UNK-984 that was all . 
 but the only thing they would not stand was back answers . 
 UNK-0 
 of course they had good reason to be UNK-984 on such a night . and then it 
 was long after ten UNK-270 and yet there was no sign of gabriel and his 
 wife . besides they were UNK-441 afraid that UNK-134 UNK-130 might 
 turn up UNK-960 . they would not wish for worlds that any of mary UNK-352 
 pupils should see him under the influence and when he was like that it 
 was sometimes very hard to manage him . UNK-134 UNK-130 always came late 
 but they UNK-105 what could be keeping gabriel and that was what 
 brought them every two minutes to the UNK-442 to ask UNK-246 had gabriel 
 or UNK-134 come . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o mr . UNK-190 " UNK-0 said UNK-246 to gabriel when she opened the door for him 
 UNK-0 " miss kate and miss julia thought you were never coming . UNK-274 
 mrs . UNK-190 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ill engage they did " UNK-0 said gabriel UNK-0 " but they forget that my wife here 
 takes three UNK-235 hours to dress herself . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he stood on the mat UNK-958 the snow from his UNK-527 while UNK-246 led 
 his wife to the foot of the UNK-93 and called out 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " miss kate UNK-182 mrs . UNK-190 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 kate and julia came UNK-731 down the dark UNK-93 at once . both of them 
 UNK-166 UNK-533 wife said she must be UNK-60 alive and asked was 
 gabriel with her . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " here i am as right as the mail UNK-7 kate ! go on up . ill follow " UNK-0 
 called out gabriel from the dark . 
 UNK-0 
 he continued UNK-958 his feet UNK-428 while the three women went 
 UNK-316 laughing to the ladies UNK-902 . a light UNK-703 of snow 
 lay like a cape on the UNK-61 of his UNK-319 and like UNK-488 on the 
 UNK-297 of his UNK-527 and as the buttons of his UNK-319 UNK-728 with a 
 UNK-327 noise through the UNK-949 UNK-997 a cold UNK-23 air 
 from UNK-225 UNK-525 from UNK-53 and UNK-47 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " is it UNK-184 again mr . UNK-190 ? " UNK-0 asked UNK-246 . 
 UNK-0 
 she had UNK-197 him into the UNK-734 to help him off with his UNK-319 . 
 gabriel UNK-24 at the three UNK-500 she had given his surname and 
 UNK-75 at her . she was a slim growing girl pale in UNK-691 and 
 with UNK-400 hair . the gas in the UNK-734 made her look still UNK-230 . 
 gabriel had known her when she was a child and used to sit on the lowest 
 step nursing a UNK-680 doll . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes UNK-246 " UNK-0 he answered UNK-0 " and i think were in for a night of it . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he looked up at the UNK-734 ceiling which was UNK-144 with the UNK-349 
 and UNK-910 of feet on the floor above UNK-126 for a moment to 
 the piano and then UNK-75 at the girl who was folding his UNK-319 
 carefully at the end of a shelf . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " tell me . UNK-246 " UNK-0 he said in a friendly tone UNK-0 " do you still go to 
 school ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o no sir " UNK-0 she answered . UNK-0 " im done UNK-714 this year and more . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o then " UNK-0 said gabriel UNK-219 UNK-0 " i suppose well be going to your wedding 
 one of these fine days with your young man eh ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the girl UNK-75 back at him over her shoulder and said with great 
 UNK-321 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " the men that is now is only all UNK-224 and what they can get out of 
 you . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel UNK-332 as if he felt he had made a mistake and without 
 looking at her UNK-986 off his UNK-527 and UNK-735 actively with his 
 UNK-540 at his UNK-781 shoes . 
 UNK-0 
 he was a UNK-98 UNK-448 young man . the high colour of his UNK-145 
 pushed UNK-356 even to his UNK-133 where it UNK-824 itself in a 
 few UNK-806 patches of pale red and on his UNK-801 face there 
 UNK-427 UNK-272 the polished lenses and the bright UNK-294 UNK-226 of 
 the glasses which UNK-245 his UNK-325 and UNK-741 eyes . his UNK-419 
 black hair was UNK-621 in the middle and UNK-30 in a long curve behind 
 his ears where it UNK-827 slightly beneath the groove left by his hat . 
 UNK-0 
 when he had UNK-735 UNK-341 into his shoes he stood up and pulled his 
 UNK-187 down more UNK-651 on his UNK-191 body . then he took a coin 
 rapidly from his pocket . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o UNK-246 " UNK-0 he said UNK-274 it into her hands UNK-0 " its UNK-900 
 UNK-50 it ? just . . . UNK-182 a little . . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he walked rapidly towards the door . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o no sir ! " UNK-0 UNK-5 the girl following him . UNK-0 " really sir i UNK-9 
 take it . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-900 ! UNK-900 ! " UNK-0 said gabriel almost UNK-287 to the 
 UNK-93 and UNK-343 his hand to her in UNK-509 . 
 UNK-0 
 the girl seeing that he had gained the UNK-93 called out after him 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well thank you sir . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-56 outside the UNK-411 door until the UNK-579 should finish 
 listening to the skirts that UNK-716 against it and to the UNK-910 of 
 feet . he was still UNK-61 by the girls UNK-412 and sudden UNK-790 . 
 it had cast a UNK-286 over him which he tried to UNK-782 by UNK-316 his 
 UNK-625 and the UNK-131 of his tie . he then took from his UNK-187 pocket a 
 little paper and UNK-75 at the UNK-24 he had made for his speech . he 
 was UNK-925 about the lines from robert UNK-284 for he UNK-60 they 
 would be above the heads of his UNK-614 . some UNK-712 that they would 
 UNK-156 from shakespeare or from the UNK-494 would be better . the 
 UNK-774 UNK-106 of the mens UNK-183 and the UNK-910 of their UNK-601 
 UNK-610 him that their grade of culture UNK-709 from his . he would 
 only make himself UNK-684 by UNK-309 poetry to them which they 
 could not understand . they would think that he was UNK-422 his superior 
 education . he would fail with them just as he had failed with the girl 
 in the UNK-734 . he had taken up a wrong tone . his whole speech was a 
 mistake from first to last an UNK-916 failure . 
 UNK-0 
 just then his UNK-37 and his wife came out of the ladies UNK-902 . 
 his UNK-37 were two small UNK-722 dressed old women . UNK-7 julia was an 
 inch or so the UNK-337 . her hair drawn low over the tops of her ears 
 was grey and grey also with UNK-13 shadows was her large UNK-831 
 face . though she was UNK-98 in build and stood UNK-705 her slow eyes and 
 UNK-621 lips gave her the appearance of a woman who did not know where 
 she was or where she was going . UNK-7 kate was more UNK-148 . her 
 face UNK-552 than her sisters was all UNK-571 and UNK-192 like a 
 UNK-421 red apple and her hair UNK-831 in the same UNK-853 
 way had not lost its ripe nut colour . 
 UNK-0 
 they both UNK-166 gabriel UNK-846 . he was their favourite UNK-401 the son 
 of their dead elder sister ellen who had married t . j . UNK-190 of the 
 port and UNK-964 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-245 tells me UNK-14 not going to take a cab back to UNK-521 
 tonight gabriel " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no " UNK-0 said gabriel turning to his wife UNK-0 " we had quite enough of that 
 last year UNK-180 we ? dont you remember UNK-7 kate what a cold UNK-245 
 got out of it ? cab windows UNK-437 all the way and the east wind 
 blowing in after we passed UNK-802 . very UNK-236 it was . UNK-245 caught a 
 UNK-348 cold . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-7 kate UNK-654 UNK-952 and UNK-146 her head at every word . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " quite right gabriel quite right " UNK-0 she said . UNK-0 " you cant be too 
 careful . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but as for UNK-245 there " UNK-0 said gabriel UNK-0 " shed walk home in the snow if 
 she were let . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mrs . UNK-190 UNK-20 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " dont mind him UNK-7 kate " UNK-0 she said . UNK-0 " UNK-2 really an awful bother 
 what with green shades for UNK-328 eyes at night and making him do the 
 UNK-746 and UNK-812 eva to eat the UNK-758 . the poor child ! and 
 she simply UNK-725 the sight of it ! . . . o but UNK-85 never guess what he 
 makes me wear now ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she broke out into a UNK-909 of UNK-31 and UNK-75 at her husband whose 
 UNK-954 and happy eyes had been UNK-254 from her dress to her face 
 and hair . the two UNK-37 UNK-20 UNK-496 too for UNK-533 UNK-890 
 was a standing joke with them . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-527 ! " UNK-0 said mrs . UNK-190 . UNK-0 " thats the latest . whenever its wet 
 UNK-432 i must put on my UNK-475 . tonight even he wanted me to put 
 them on but i UNK-9 . the next thing hell buy me will be a diving 
 suit . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel UNK-20 UNK-409 and UNK-788 his tie UNK-62 while UNK-7 
 kate nearly UNK-307 herself so UNK-496 did she enjoy the joke . the 
 smile soon UNK-238 from UNK-7 UNK-468 face and her UNK-909 eyes were 
 directed towards her UNK-595 face . after a UNK-242 she asked 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and what are UNK-527 gabriel ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-527 julia ! " UNK-0 UNK-751 her sister UNK-0 " UNK-403 me dont you know 
 what UNK-527 are ? you wear them over your . . . over your boots UNK-245 
 UNK-50 it ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes " UNK-0 said mrs . UNK-190 . UNK-0 " UNK-509 things . we both have a pair now . 
 gabriel says everyone UNK-665 them on the continent . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o on the continent " UNK-0 UNK-203 UNK-7 julia UNK-278 her head slowly . 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel UNK-756 his UNK-490 and said as if he were slightly UNK-325 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " its nothing very wonderful but UNK-245 thinks it very funny because 
 she says the word UNK-137 her of UNK-753 UNK-392 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but tell me gabriel " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate with UNK-517 UNK-159 . UNK-0 " of course 
 UNK-628 seen about the room . UNK-245 was saying . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o the room is all right " UNK-0 replied gabriel . UNK-0 " UNK-201 taken one in the 
 UNK-723 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " to be sure " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate UNK-0 " by far the best thing to do . and the 
 children UNK-245 UNK-14 not UNK-860 about them ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o for one night " UNK-0 said mrs . UNK-190 . UNK-0 " besides UNK-980 will look after 
 them . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " to be sure " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate again . UNK-0 " what a comfort it is to have a girl 
 like that one you can depend on ! UNK-6 that UNK-246 im sure i dont 
 know what has come over her lately . UNK-23 not the girl she was at all . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel was about to ask his UNK-7 some questions on this point but she 
 broke off suddenly to UNK-49 after her sister who had UNK-326 down the 
 UNK-93 and was UNK-819 her neck over the UNK-442 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " now i ask you " UNK-0 she said almost UNK-785 UNK-0 " where is julia going ? julia ! 
 julia ! where are you going ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 julia who had gone half way down one flight came back and announced 
 UNK-982 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-182 UNK-134 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 at the same moment a UNK-374 of hands and a final UNK-588 of the 
 UNK-692 told that the UNK-579 had ended . the UNK-411 door was opened 
 from within and some couples came out . UNK-7 kate drew gabriel aside 
 UNK-72 and UNK-222 into his ear 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " slip down gabriel like a good fellow and see if UNK-2 all right and 
 dont let him up if UNK-2 UNK-960 . im sure UNK-2 UNK-960 . im sure he 
 is . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel went to the UNK-93 and UNK-126 over the UNK-442 . he could 
 hear two persons talking in the UNK-734 . then he recognised UNK-134 
 UNK-130 laugh . he went down the UNK-93 UNK-267 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " its such a relief " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate to mrs . UNK-190 UNK-0 " that gabriel is 
 here . i always feel easier in my mind when UNK-2 here . . . . julia UNK-6 
 miss UNK-954 and miss power will take some UNK-732 . thanks for your 
 beautiful UNK-579 miss UNK-954 . it made lovely time . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 a tall UNK-580 man with a UNK-257 UNK-635 UNK-91 and UNK-64 
 skin who was passing out with his partner said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and may we have some UNK-732 too miss UNK-568 ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " julia " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate UNK-153 UNK-0 " and UNK-182 mr . UNK-78 and miss 
 UNK-987 . take them in julia with miss UNK-954 and miss power . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " im the man for the ladies " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-78 UNK-651 his lips until 
 his UNK-91 UNK-784 and UNK-21 in all his UNK-378 . UNK-0 " you know miss 
 UNK-568 the reason they are so UNK-345 of me is " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he did not finish his sentence but seeing that UNK-7 kate was out of 
 UNK-691 at once led the three young ladies into the back room . the 
 middle of the room was occupied by two square tables placed end to 
 end and on these UNK-7 julia and the UNK-72 were UNK-858 
 and UNK-899 a large cloth . on the UNK-839 were UNK-655 dishes and 
 plates and glasses and UNK-449 of knives and UNK-689 and UNK-521 . the top 
 of the closed square piano served also as a UNK-839 for UNK-716 
 and UNK-240 . at a smaller UNK-839 in one corner two young men were 
 standing drinking UNK-131 .

 mr . UNK-78 led his charges UNK-467 and invited them all in UNK-545 to 
 some ladies punch hot strong and sweet . as they said they never took 
 anything strong he opened three bottles of UNK-543 for them . then 
 he asked one of the young men to move aside and taking hold of the 
 UNK-933 filled out for himself a UNK-582 measure of UNK-224 . the young 
 men eyed him UNK-649 while he took a trial sip . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " god help me " UNK-0 he said UNK-21 UNK-0 " its the doctors orders . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 his UNK-100 face broke into a broader smile and the three young ladies 
 UNK-20 in musical echo to his UNK-762 UNK-223 their bodies to and 
 UNK-161 with nervous UNK-708 of their UNK-61 . the UNK-981 said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o now mr . UNK-78 im sure the doctor never ordered anything of the 
 kind . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-78 took another sip of his UNK-224 and said with UNK-119 
 UNK-376 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well you see im like the famous mrs . UNK-676 who is reported to 
 have said now mary UNK-895 if i dont take it make me take it for i 
 feel i want it . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 his hot face had UNK-122 forward a little too UNK-237 and he had 
 assumed a very low dublin accent so that the young ladies with one 
 UNK-375 received his speech in silence . miss UNK-987 who was one 
 of mary UNK-352 pupils asked miss UNK-954 what was the name of the pretty 
 UNK-579 she had played and mr . UNK-78 seeing that he was ignored turned 
 promptly to the two young men who were more UNK-707 . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-171 young woman dressed in UNK-249 came into the room UNK-92 
 UNK-374 her hands and UNK-273 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-177 ! UNK-177 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 close on her UNK-183 came UNK-7 kate UNK-273 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " two UNK-32 and three ladies mary jane ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o UNK-182 mr . UNK-500 and mr . UNK-461 " UNK-0 said mary jane . UNK-0 " mr . UNK-461 
 will you take miss power ? miss UNK-987 may i get you a partner mr . 
 UNK-500 . o UNK-397 just do now . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " three ladies mary jane " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate . 
 UNK-0 
 the two young UNK-32 asked the ladies if they might have the 
 pleasure and mary jane turned to miss UNK-954 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o miss UNK-954 UNK-14 really UNK-229 good after playing for the last 
 two UNK-184 but really were so short of ladies tonight . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i dont mind in the least miss UNK-568 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but UNK-201 a nice partner for you mr . UNK-334 UNK-184 the UNK-228 . ill 
 get him to sing later on . all dublin is UNK-222 about him . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " lovely voice lovely voice ! " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate . 
 UNK-0 
 as the piano had twice begun the UNK-264 to the first figure mary jane 
 led her UNK-751 quickly from the room . they had hardly gone when UNK-7 
 julia UNK-326 slowly into the room looking behind her at something . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what is the matter julia ? " UNK-0 asked UNK-7 kate UNK-125 . UNK-0 " who is it ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 julia who was carrying in a column of UNK-441 turned to her 
 sister and said simply as if the question had surprised her 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " its only UNK-134 kate and gabriel with him . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 in fact right behind her gabriel could be seen UNK-394 UNK-134 UNK-130 
 across the landing . the latter a young man of about forty was of 
 UNK-533 size and build with very round UNK-61 . his face was UNK-375 
 and UNK-13 touched with colour only at the thick hanging UNK-826 of his 
 ears and at the wide wings of his nose . he had UNK-997 features a 
 UNK-436 nose a UNK-587 and UNK-229 UNK-195 UNK-943 and UNK-847 lips . his 
 UNK-191 eyes and the disorder of his UNK-72 hair made him look 
 UNK-638 . he was laughing UNK-496 in a high key at a story which he had 
 been telling gabriel on the UNK-93 and at the same time UNK-166 the 
 UNK-205 of his left fist UNK-940 and UNK-914 into his left eye . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-116 UNK-134 " UNK-0 said UNK-7 julia . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-134 UNK-130 UNK-432 the UNK-65 UNK-568 UNK-116 in what seemed an 
 UNK-202 fashion by reason of the UNK-999 catch in his voice and then 
 seeing that mr . UNK-78 was UNK-549 at him from the UNK-839 UNK-112 
 the room on rather UNK-204 legs and began to repeat in an UNK-286 the 
 story he had just told to gabriel . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-2 not so bad is he ? " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate to gabriel . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-533 UNK-490 were dark but he raised them quickly and answered 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o no hardly UNK-595 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " now UNK-50 he a terrible fellow ! " UNK-0 she said . UNK-0 " and his poor mother made 
 him take the pledge on new years eve . but come on gabriel into the 
 UNK-411 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 before leaving the room with gabriel she UNK-179 to mr . UNK-78 by 
 UNK-449 and UNK-144 her UNK-487 in warning to and UNK-161 . mr . UNK-78 
 UNK-146 in answer and when she had gone said to UNK-134 UNK-130 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " now then teddy im going to fill you out a good glass of UNK-543 
 just to buck you up . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-134 UNK-130 who was UNK-356 the UNK-349 of his story UNK-234 the offer 
 aside UNK-782 but mr . UNK-78 having first called UNK-134 UNK-130 
 attention to a UNK-434 in his dress filled out and handed him a 
 full glass of UNK-543 . UNK-134 UNK-130 left hand accepted the 
 glass UNK-573 his right hand being engaged in the mechanical 
 UNK-538 of his dress . mr . UNK-78 whose face was once more 
 UNK-424 with UNK-899 UNK-207 out for himself a glass of UNK-224 while 
 UNK-134 UNK-130 UNK-492 before he had well reached the UNK-349 of his 
 story in a UNK-100 of UNK-691 UNK-173 UNK-31 and setting down 
 his UNK-304 and UNK-779 glass began to UNK-936 the UNK-205 of his 
 left fist UNK-940 and UNK-914 into his left eye UNK-598 words of 
 his last phrase as well as his fit of UNK-31 would allow him . 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel could not listen while mary jane was playing her academy piece 
 full of runs and difficult UNK-409 to the UNK-606 UNK-411 . he 
 liked music but the piece she was playing had no UNK-922 for him and he 
 UNK-37 whether it had any UNK-922 for the other UNK-797 though they 
 had UNK-113 mary jane to play something . four young men who had come 
 from the UNK-988 to stand in the UNK-102 at the sound of the 
 piano had gone away UNK-40 in couples after a few minutes . the only 
 persons who seemed to follow the music were mary jane herself her hands 
 racing along the keyboard or UNK-64 from it at the UNK-446 like those 
 of a UNK-876 in UNK-88 UNK-722 and UNK-7 kate standing at her 
 UNK-213 to turn the page . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-533 eyes UNK-120 by the floor which UNK-919 with UNK-183 
 under the heavy UNK-164 UNK-326 to the wall above the piano . a 
 picture of the UNK-994 scene in UNK-148 and UNK-262 hung there and beside 
 it was a picture of the two UNK-353 UNK-424 in the tower which UNK-7 
 julia had worked in red blue and brown UNK-725 when she was a girl . 
 probably in the school they had gone to as girls that kind of work had 
 been taught for one year . his mother had worked for him as a birthday 
 present a UNK-187 of purple UNK-780 with little UNK-235 heads upon it 
 lined with brown satin and having round UNK-588 buttons . it was strange 
 that his mother had had no musical talent though UNK-7 kate used to call 
 her the UNK-439 carrier of the UNK-568 family . both she and julia had 
 always seemed a little proud of their serious and UNK-851 sister . her 
 photograph stood before the UNK-526 . she held an open book on her 
 UNK-111 and was pointing out something in it to UNK-717 who dressed 
 in a UNK-556 suit lay at her feet . it was she who had chosen the name 
 of her sons for she was very UNK-629 of the UNK-491 of family life . 
 thanks to her UNK-717 was now senior UNK-114 in UNK-190 and 
 thanks to her gabriel himself had taken his degree in the royal 
 university . a shadow passed over his face as he remembered her UNK-332 
 opposition to his marriage . some UNK-515 phrases she had used still 
 UNK-664 in his memory she had once spoken of UNK-245 as being country 
 cute and that was not true of UNK-245 at all . it was UNK-245 who had 
 UNK-853 her during all her last long illness in their house at UNK-521 . 
 UNK-0 
 he knew that mary jane must be near the end of her piece for she was 
 playing again the opening UNK-922 with runs of scales after every bar and 
 while he UNK-56 for the end the UNK-617 died down in his heart . 
 the piece ended with a UNK-223 of UNK-692 in the UNK-400 and a final deep 
 UNK-885 in the bass . great UNK-541 UNK-593 mary jane as UNK-521 and 
 rolling up her music UNK-409 she UNK-525 from the room . the most 
 UNK-363 UNK-374 came from the four young men in the UNK-102 who had 
 gone away to the UNK-988 at the beginning of the piece but had 
 come back when the piano had stopped . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-326 were arranged . gabriel found himself UNK-206 with miss UNK-227 . 
 she was a UNK-216 UNK-878 young lady with a UNK-977 face and 
 prominent brown eyes . she did not wear a UNK-817 UNK-625 and the large 
 UNK-813 which was fixed in the front of her collar UNK-135 on it an irish 
 device and UNK-595 . 
 UNK-0 
 when they had taken their places she said UNK-740 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i have a UNK-936 to UNK-397 with you . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " with me ? " UNK-0 said gabriel . 
 UNK-0 
 she UNK-146 her head UNK-141 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what is it ? " UNK-0 asked gabriel UNK-21 at her UNK-384 manner . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " who is g . c . ? " UNK-0 answered miss UNK-227 turning her eyes upon him . 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel UNK-332 and was about to knit his UNK-490 as if he did not 
 understand when she said UNK-770 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o innocent amy ! i have found out that you write for the daily express . 
 now UNK-602 you UNK-252 of yourself ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " why should i be UNK-252 of myself ? " UNK-0 asked gabriel UNK-717 his eyes 
 and trying to smile . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well im UNK-252 of you " UNK-0 said miss UNK-227 UNK-846 . UNK-0 " to say UNK-306 write 
 for a paper like that . i UNK-3 think you were a west UNK-898 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 a look of UNK-812 appeared on UNK-533 face . it was true that he 
 wrote a literary column every wednesday in the daily express for which 
 he was paid fifteen UNK-51 . but that did not make him a west UNK-898 
 surely . the books he received for review were almost more welcome than 
 the UNK-487 cheque . he loved to feel the covers and turn over the pages 
 of newly printed books . nearly every day when his teaching in the 
 college was ended he used to UNK-588 down the UNK-719 to the UNK-674 
 UNK-402 to UNK-27 on UNK-816 walk to UNK-621 or UNK-84 on 
 UNK-70 UNK-118 or to UNK-522 in the UNK-422 . he did not know how 
 to meet her charge . he wanted to say that literature was above politics . 
 but they were friends of many years standing and their careers had been 
 parallel first at the university and then as teachers he could not 
 risk a UNK-57 phrase with her . he continued UNK-717 his eyes and 
 trying to smile and UNK-203 UNK-775 that he saw nothing political in 
 writing reviews of books . 
 UNK-0 
 when their turn to cross had come he was still UNK-150 and 
 UNK-485 . miss UNK-227 promptly took his hand in a warm UNK-111 and said 
 in a soft friendly tone 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " of course i was only UNK-434 . come we cross now . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 when they were together again she spoke of the university question and 
 gabriel felt more at ease . a friend of UNK-349 had shown her his review 
 of UNK-174 poems . that was how she had found out the secret but she 
 liked the review UNK-172 . then she said suddenly 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o mr . UNK-190 will you come for an UNK-880 to the UNK-624 UNK-321 this 
 summer ? were going to stay there a whole month . it will be UNK-288 
 out in the atlantic . you ought to come . mr . UNK-503 is coming and mr . 
 UNK-239 and UNK-464 UNK-63 . it would be UNK-288 for UNK-245 too if 
 shed come . UNK-23 from UNK-97 UNK-50 she ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " her people are " UNK-0 said gabriel shortly . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but you will come UNK-19 you ? " UNK-0 said miss UNK-227 UNK-889 her warm hand 
 UNK-433 on his arm . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " the fact is " UNK-0 said gabriel UNK-0 " i have just arranged to go " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " go where ? " UNK-0 asked miss UNK-227 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well you know every year i go for a cycling tour with some UNK-13 
 and so " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but where ? " UNK-0 asked miss UNK-227 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well we usually go to france or belgium or perhaps germany " UNK-0 said 
 gabriel UNK-583 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and why do you go to france and belgium " UNK-0 said miss UNK-227 UNK-0 " instead of 
 visiting your own land ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well " UNK-0 said gabriel UNK-0 " its partly to keep in touch with the languages 
 and partly for a change . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and UNK-204 you your own language to keep in touch UNK-437 ? " UNK-0 asked 
 miss UNK-227 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well " UNK-0 said gabriel UNK-0 " if it comes to that you know irish is not my 
 language . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 their UNK-611 had turned to listen to the UNK-856 . gabriel 
 UNK-75 right and left UNK-409 and tried to keep his good UNK-179 under 
 the UNK-868 which was making a UNK-801 UNK-215 his UNK-133 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and UNK-204 you your own land to visit " UNK-0 continued miss UNK-227 UNK-0 " that 
 you know nothing of your own people and your own country ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o to tell you the truth " UNK-0 UNK-210 gabriel suddenly UNK-0 " im sick of my 
 own country sick of it ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " why ? " UNK-0 asked miss UNK-227 . 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel did not answer for his UNK-790 had heated him . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " why ? " UNK-0 repeated miss UNK-227 . 
 UNK-0 
 they had to go visiting together and as he had not answered her miss 
 UNK-227 said UNK-807 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " of course UNK-628 no answer . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel tried to cover his UNK-626 by taking part in the dance with 
 great energy . he UNK-802 her eyes for he had seen a UNK-878 expression on 
 her face . but when they met in the long chain he was surprised to feel 
 his hand UNK-419 pressed . she looked at him from under her UNK-490 for a 
 moment UNK-114 until he UNK-24 . then just as the chain was about to 
 start again she stood on UNK-649 and UNK-222 into his ear 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " west UNK-898 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 when the UNK-326 were over gabriel went away to a remote corner of the 
 room where UNK-134 UNK-130 mother was sitting . she was a UNK-98 UNK-879 old 
 woman with white hair . her voice had a catch in it like her sons and 
 she UNK-770 slightly . she had been told that UNK-134 had come and that 
 he was nearly all right . gabriel asked her whether she had had a good 
 crossing . she lived with her married daughter in glasgow and came to 
 dublin on a visit once a year . she answered UNK-389 that she had had a 
 beautiful crossing and that the captain had been most UNK-308 to her . 
 she spoke also of the beautiful house her daughter kept in glasgow and 
 of all the friends they had there . while her tongue UNK-342 on gabriel 
 tried to UNK-873 from his mind all memory of the UNK-144 incident with 
 miss UNK-227 . of course the girl or woman or whatever she was was an 
 UNK-481 but there was a time for all things . perhaps he ought not 
 to have answered her like that . but she had no right to call him a west 
 UNK-898 before people even in joke . she had tried to make him UNK-684 
 before people UNK-354 him and UNK-151 at him with her UNK-682 eyes . 
 UNK-0 
 he saw his wife making her way towards him through the UNK-317 couples . 
 when she reached him she said into his ear 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " gabriel UNK-7 kate wants to know UNK-19 you UNK-72 the UNK-583 as usual . 
 miss UNK-954 will UNK-72 the ham and ill do the UNK-494 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " all right " UNK-0 said gabriel . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-23 sending in the younger ones first as soon as this UNK-579 is over 
 so that well have the table to ourselves . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " were you dancing ? " UNK-0 asked gabriel . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " of course i was . UNK-3 you see me ? what row had you with UNK-36 UNK-227 ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no row . why ? did she say so ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " something like that . im trying to get that mr . UNK-184 to sing . UNK-2 
 full of UNK-57 i think . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " there was no row " UNK-0 said gabriel UNK-476 UNK-0 " only she wanted me to go for 
 a trip to the west of ireland and i said i UNK-9 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 his wife UNK-669 her hands UNK-92 and gave a little jump . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o do go gabriel " UNK-0 she UNK-5 . UNK-0 " id love to see UNK-553 again . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " you can go if you like " UNK-0 said gabriel UNK-482 . 
 UNK-0 
 she looked at him for a moment then turned to mrs . UNK-130 and said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-6 a nice husband for you mrs . UNK-130 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 while she was UNK-790 her way back across the room mrs . UNK-130 
 without UNK-295 to the UNK-180 went on to tell gabriel what 
 beautiful places there were in scotland and beautiful UNK-488 . her 
 UNK-67 brought them every year to the lakes and they used to go 
 fishing . her UNK-67 was a UNK-288 fisher . one day he caught a 
 beautiful big fish and the man in the hotel cooked it for their dinner . 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel hardly heard what she said . now that UNK-255 was coming near he 
 began to think again about his speech and about the UNK-712 . when he 
 saw UNK-134 UNK-130 coming across the room to visit his mother gabriel 
 left the chair free for him and retired into the UNK-100 of the 
 window . the room had already cleared and from the back room came the 
 UNK-302 of plates and knives . those who still remained in the 
 UNK-411 seemed tired of dancing and were UNK-371 UNK-40 in little 
 groups . UNK-533 warm UNK-178 fingers UNK-408 the cold UNK-899 of the 
 window . how cool it must be outside ! how pleasant it would be to walk 
 out alone first along by the river and then through the park ! the snow 
 would be lying on the branches of the trees and forming a bright cap on 
 the top of the wellington UNK-471 . how much more pleasant it would be 
 there than at the UNK-81 ! 
 UNK-0 
 he ran over the UNK-24 of his speech irish hospitality sad memories 
 the three UNK-799 paris the UNK-712 from UNK-284 . he repeated to 
 himself a phrase he had written in his review UNK-0 " one feels that one is 
 listening to a UNK-83 music . " UNK-0 miss UNK-227 had UNK-14 the 
 review . was she UNK-63 ? had she really any life of her own behind all 
 her UNK-814 ? there had never been any UNK-935 between them 
 until that night . it UNK-180 him to think that she would be at the 
 UNK-81 looking up at him while he spoke with her critical 
 UNK-875 eyes . perhaps she would not be sorry to see him fail in his 
 speech . an idea came into his mind and gave him courage . he would 
 say UNK-777 to UNK-7 kate and UNK-7 julia UNK-0 " ladies and UNK-32 the 
 generation which is now on the UNK-437 among us may have had its UNK-613 but 
 for my part i think it had certain qualities of hospitality of UNK-179 
 of humanity which the new and very serious and UNK-553 generation 
 that is growing up around us seems to me to lack . " UNK-0 very good that 
 was one for miss UNK-227 . what did he care that his UNK-37 were only two 
 UNK-814 old women ? 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-208 in the room UNK-57 his attention . mr . UNK-78 was UNK-796 
 from the door UNK-37 UNK-184 UNK-7 julia who UNK-122 upon his arm 
 UNK-21 and hanging her head . an UNK-167 UNK-802 of UNK-541 UNK-666 
 her also as far as the piano and then as mary jane UNK-154 herself on 
 the UNK-518 and UNK-7 julia no longer UNK-21 half turned so as to pitch 
 her voice fairly into the room gradually UNK-167 . gabriel recognised 
 the UNK-264 . it was that of an old song of UNK-7 UNK-334 for the 
 bridal . her voice strong and clear in tone attacked with great spirit 
 the runs which UNK-265 the air and though she UNK-57 very rapidly she 
 did not miss even the smallest of the grace notes . to follow the 
 voice without looking at the UNK-63 face was to feel and share the 
 excitement of swift and secure flight . gabriel UNK-737 UNK-76 with all 
 the others at the close of the song and loud UNK-541 was UNK-618 in from 
 the invisible UNK-81 . it UNK-224 so genuine that a little 
 colour UNK-250 into UNK-7 UNK-468 face as she bent to replace in the 
 UNK-745 the old UNK-30 UNK-988 that had her UNK-642 on the 
 cover . UNK-134 UNK-130 who had UNK-126 with his head UNK-665 UNK-174 to 
 hear her better was still UNK-899 when everyone else had UNK-167 and 
 talking UNK-827 to his mother who UNK-146 her head UNK-141 and slowly 
 in UNK-828 . at last when he could UNK-840 no more he stood up 
 suddenly and UNK-569 across the room to UNK-7 julia whose hand he UNK-457 
 and held in both his hands UNK-144 it when words failed him or the 
 catch in his voice proved too much for him . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i was just telling my mother " UNK-0 he said UNK-0 " i never heard you sing so 
 well never . no i never heard your voice so good as it is tonight . now ! 
 would you believe that now ? thats the truth . upon my word and UNK-88 
 thats the truth . i never heard your voice sound so fresh and so . . . so 
 clear and fresh never . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-7 julia UNK-24 UNK-839 and UNK-203 something about UNK-857 as 
 she released her hand from his UNK-111 . mr . UNK-78 extended his open 
 hand towards her and said to those who were near him in the manner of a 
 UNK-847 introducing a UNK-844 to an audience 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " miss julia UNK-568 my latest discovery ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he was laughing very UNK-496 at this himself when UNK-134 UNK-130 turned 
 to him and said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well UNK-78 if UNK-14 serious you might make a worse discovery . all 
 i can say is i never heard her sing half so well as long as i am coming 
 here . and thats the honest truth . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " neither did i " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-78 . UNK-0 " i think her voice has greatly 
 improved . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-7 julia UNK-57 her UNK-61 and said with UNK-965 pride 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " thirty years ago i UNK-180 a bad voice as voices go . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i often told julia " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate UNK-695 UNK-0 " that she was simply 
 thrown away in that choir . but she never would be said by me . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she turned as if to appeal to the good sense of the others against a 
 UNK-737 child while UNK-7 julia UNK-84 in front of her a UNK-209 smile 
 of UNK-468 playing on her face . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no " UNK-0 continued UNK-7 kate UNK-0 " she UNK-9 be said or led by anyone 
 UNK-193 there in that choir night and day night and day . six UNK-270 on 
 christmas morning ! and all for what ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well UNK-50 it for the UNK-88 of god UNK-7 kate ? " UNK-0 asked mary jane 
 UNK-990 round on the UNK-930 and UNK-21 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-7 kate turned UNK-809 on her UNK-349 and said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i know all about the UNK-88 of god mary jane but i think its not at 
 all UNK-176 for the pope to turn out the women out of the UNK-77 that 
 have UNK-885 there all their lives and put little UNK-721 of 
 boys over their heads . i suppose it is for the good of the church if the 
 pope does it . but its not just mary jane and its not right . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she had worked herself into a passion and would have continued in 
 defence of her sister for it was a UNK-713 subject with her but mary jane 
 seeing that all the UNK-784 had come back UNK-575 UNK-949 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " now UNK-7 kate UNK-14 giving UNK-47 to mr . UNK-78 who is of the other 
 UNK-306 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-7 kate turned to mr . UNK-78 who was UNK-549 at this UNK-858 to his 
 religion and said UNK-542 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o i dont question the UNK-744 being right . im only a stupid old woman 
 and i UNK-9 UNK-824 to do such a thing . but UNK-6 such a thing as 
 common everyday UNK-474 and UNK-980 . and if i were in UNK-468 place 
 id tell that father UNK-782 straight up to his face . . . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and besides UNK-7 kate " UNK-0 said mary jane UNK-0 " we really are all hungry and 
 when we are hungry we are all very UNK-247 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and when we are UNK-403 we are also UNK-247 " UNK-0 added mr . UNK-78 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " so that we had better go to UNK-255 " UNK-0 said mary jane UNK-0 " and finish the 
 discussion afterwards . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 on the landing outside the UNK-411 gabriel found his wife and mary 
 jane trying to UNK-119 miss UNK-227 to stay for UNK-255 . but miss UNK-227 
 who had put on her hat and was UNK-541 her UNK-382 would not stay . 
 she did not feel in the least hungry and she had already UNK-283 her 
 time . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but only for ten minutes UNK-36 " UNK-0 said mrs . UNK-190 . UNK-0 " that UNK-19 delay 
 you . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " to take a pick itself " UNK-0 said mary jane UNK-0 " after all your dancing . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i really UNK-18 " UNK-0 said miss UNK-227 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i am afraid you UNK-3 enjoy yourself at all " UNK-0 said mary jane 
 UNK-649 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ever so much i assure you " UNK-0 said miss UNK-227 UNK-0 " but you really must let 
 me run off now . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but how can you get home ? " UNK-0 asked mrs . UNK-190 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o its only two steps up the UNK-118 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel UNK-767 a moment and said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " if you will allow me miss UNK-227 ill see you home if you are really 
 UNK-499 to go . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 but miss UNK-227 broke away from them . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i UNK-19 hear of it " UNK-0 she UNK-5 . UNK-0 " for UNK-403 sake go in to your 
 UNK-209 and dont mind me . im quite well able to take care of myself . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well UNK-14 the UNK-558 girl UNK-36 " UNK-0 said mrs . UNK-190 UNK-846 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-960 UNK-741 " UNK-0 UNK-5 miss UNK-227 with a laugh as she ran down the 
 UNK-116 . 
 UNK-0 
 mary jane UNK-84 after her a UNK-712 UNK-555 expression on her face 
 while mrs . UNK-190 UNK-122 over the UNK-442 to listen for the UNK-581 . 
 gabriel asked himself was he the cause of her UNK-52 departure . but she 
 did not seem to be in ill UNK-179 she had gone away laughing . he UNK-156 
 UNK-672 down the UNK-116 . 
 UNK-0 
 at the moment UNK-7 kate came UNK-731 out of the UNK-131 almost 
 UNK-880 her hands in UNK-85 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " where is gabriel ? " UNK-0 she UNK-5 . UNK-0 " where on earth is gabriel ? UNK-6 
 everyone waiting in there stage to let and nobody to UNK-72 the UNK-583 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " here i am UNK-7 kate ! " UNK-0 UNK-5 gabriel with sudden animation UNK-0 " ready to 
 UNK-72 a UNK-275 of UNK-793 if necessary . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 a fat brown UNK-583 lay at one end of the table and at the other end on 
 a bed of UNK-756 paper UNK-88 with UNK-323 of UNK-548 lay a great ham 
 UNK-627 of its outer skin and UNK-942 over with UNK-584 UNK-936 a UNK-522 
 paper UNK-56 round its UNK-67 and beside this was a round of UNK-287 beef . 
 between these UNK-907 ends ran parallel lines of UNK-227 two little 
 UNK-493 of UNK-325 red and yellow a UNK-502 dish full of blocks 
 of UNK-83 and red jam a large green UNK-973 dish with a 
 UNK-694 handle on which lay UNK-448 of purple UNK-29 and UNK-96 
 UNK-657 a companion dish on which lay a solid UNK-176 of UNK-902 
 UNK-391 a dish of UNK-342 UNK-495 with UNK-892 UNK-314 a small bowl full of 
 UNK-647 and UNK-240 wrapped in gold and silver papers and a glass UNK-286 
 in which stood some tall UNK-461 UNK-951 . in the centre of the table there 
 stood as UNK-922 to a UNK-430 which UNK-165 a UNK-10 of UNK-725 
 and american UNK-607 two UNK-737 UNK-853 UNK-640 of cut glass one 
 containing port and the other dark UNK-128 . on the closed square piano 
 a UNK-494 in a huge yellow dish lay in waiting and behind it were three 
 UNK-417 of bottles of UNK-98 and UNK-556 and minerals drawn up according to 
 the colours of their UNK-591 the first two black with brown and 
 red labels the third and smallest squad white with UNK-916 green 
 UNK-291 . 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel took his seat UNK-258 at the head of the table and having looked 
 to the edge of the UNK-27 UNK-284 his fork UNK-419 into the UNK-583 . he 
 felt quite at ease now for he was an expert UNK-27 and liked nothing 
 better than to find himself at the head of a UNK-864 table . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " miss UNK-987 what shall i send you ? " UNK-0 he asked . UNK-0 " a wing or a UNK-676 of 
 the breast ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " just a small UNK-676 of the breast . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " miss UNK-565 what for you ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o anything at all mr . UNK-190 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 while gabriel and miss UNK-954 UNK-45 plates of UNK-583 and plates of ham 
 and UNK-287 beef UNK-246 went from guest to guest with a dish of hot UNK-493 
 potatoes wrapped in a white UNK-979 . this was mary UNK-352 idea and she 
 had also suggested apple sauce for the UNK-583 but UNK-7 kate had said that 
 plain UNK-211 UNK-583 without any apple sauce had always been good enough 
 for her and she hoped she might never eat worse . mary jane UNK-56 on 
 her pupils and saw that they got the best UNK-174 and UNK-7 kate and UNK-7 
 julia opened and carried across from the piano bottles of UNK-98 and UNK-556 
 for the UNK-32 and bottles of minerals for the ladies . there was a 
 great deal of confusion and UNK-31 and noise the noise of orders 
 and UNK-624 of knives and UNK-689 of UNK-684 and UNK-872 . 
 gabriel began to UNK-72 second UNK-941 as soon as he had finished the 
 first round without serving himself . everyone UNK-49 UNK-76 so that 
 he UNK-555 by taking a long UNK-643 of UNK-98 for he had found the 
 UNK-211 hot work . mary jane settled down UNK-40 to her UNK-255 but UNK-7 
 kate and UNK-7 julia were still UNK-731 round the table walking on 
 each others UNK-183 getting in each others way and giving each other 
 UNK-451 orders . mr . UNK-78 UNK-113 of them to sit down and eat their 
 UNK-209 and so did gabriel but they said there was time enough so that 
 at last UNK-134 UNK-130 stood up and UNK-2 UNK-7 kate UNK-727 her 
 down on her chair UNK-22 general UNK-31 . 
 UNK-0 
 when everyone had been well served gabriel said UNK-21 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " now if anyone wants a little more of what UNK-314 people call UNK-467 
 let him or her speak . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 a chorus of voices invited him to begin his own UNK-255 and UNK-246 came 
 forward with three potatoes which she had reserved for him . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " very well " UNK-0 said gabriel UNK-760 as he took another UNK-515 
 UNK-643 UNK-0 " UNK-320 forget my existence ladies and UNK-32 for a few 
 minutes . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he set to his UNK-255 and took no part in the conversation with which the 
 table covered UNK-704 removal of the plates . the subject of talk was the 
 opera company which was then at the theatre royal . mr . UNK-334 UNK-184 
 the UNK-228 a UNK-829 young man with a smart UNK-91 UNK-14 
 very highly the leading UNK-77 of the company but miss UNK-987 
 thought she had a rather UNK-314 style of production . UNK-134 UNK-130 said 
 there was a UNK-946 UNK-374 singing in the second part of the UNK-671 
 UNK-715 who had one of the finest UNK-228 voices he had ever heard . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " have you heard him ? " UNK-0 he asked mr . UNK-334 UNK-184 across the table . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no " UNK-0 answered mr . UNK-334 UNK-184 UNK-493 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " because " UNK-0 UNK-134 UNK-130 explained UNK-0 " now id be curious to hear your 
 opinion of him . i think he has a grand voice . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " it takes teddy to find out the really good things " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-78 
 UNK-108 to the table . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and why UNK-18 he have a voice too ? " UNK-0 asked UNK-134 UNK-130 UNK-278 . UNK-0 " is 
 it because UNK-2 only a black ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 nobody answered this question and mary jane led the table back to the 
 legitimate opera . one of her pupils had given her a pass for UNK-936 . 
 of course it was very fine she said but it made her think of poor 
 UNK-450 burns . mr . UNK-78 could go back UNK-199 still to the old 
 italian companies that used to come to UNK-975 UNK-390 de UNK-58 
 UNK-348 the great UNK-890 UNK-256 UNK-176 UNK-681 . those were 
 the days he said when there was something like singing to be heard in 
 dublin . he told too of how the top gallery of the old royal used to be 
 packed night after night of how one night an italian UNK-228 had UNK-903 
 five UNK-229 to let me like a soldier fall introducing a high c every 
 time and of how the gallery boys would sometimes in their UNK-311 
 UNK-763 the horses from the UNK-114 of some great UNK-681 donna and pull 
 her themselves through the streets to her hotel . why did they never play 
 the grand old UNK-611 now he asked UNK-432 UNK-416 UNK-146 ? because 
 they could not get the voices to sing them that was why . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " oh well " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-334 UNK-184 UNK-0 " i UNK-824 there are as good 
 UNK-63 today as there were then . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " where are they ? " UNK-0 asked mr . UNK-78 UNK-162 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " in london paris milan " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-334 UNK-184 UNK-807 . UNK-0 " i suppose 
 UNK-956 for example is quite as good if not better than any of the men 
 you have mentioned . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " maybe so " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-78 . UNK-0 " but i may tell you i doubt it strongly . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o id give anything to hear UNK-956 sing " UNK-0 said mary jane . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " for me " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate who had been picking a bone UNK-0 " there was only 
 one UNK-228 . to please me i mean . but i suppose none of you ever heard of 
 him . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " who was he miss UNK-568 ? " UNK-0 asked mr . UNK-334 UNK-184 UNK-269 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " his name " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate UNK-0 " was UNK-44 . i heard him when he was in 
 his prime and i think he had then the UNK-680 UNK-228 voice that was ever 
 put into a UNK-54 throat . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " strange " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-334 UNK-184 . UNK-0 " i never even heard of him . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes yes miss UNK-568 is right " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-78 . UNK-0 " i remember hearing 
 of old UNK-44 but UNK-2 too far back for me . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " a beautiful pure sweet UNK-154 english UNK-228 " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate with 
 UNK-311 . 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel having finished the huge UNK-494 was transferred to the table . 
 the UNK-302 of UNK-689 and UNK-521 began again . UNK-533 wife served out 
 UNK-485 of the UNK-494 and passed the plates down the table . UNK-216 
 down they were held up by mary jane who UNK-348 them with UNK-752 
 or orange UNK-325 or with UNK-83 and jam . the UNK-494 was of UNK-7 
 UNK-468 making and she received UNK-383 for it from all quarters . she 
 herself said that it was not quite brown enough . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well i hope miss UNK-568 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-78 UNK-0 " that im brown enough for 
 you because you know im all brown . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 all the UNK-32 except gabriel ate some of the UNK-494 out of 
 UNK-805 to UNK-7 julia . as gabriel never ate UNK-240 the UNK-461 had 
 been left for him . UNK-134 UNK-130 also took a UNK-281 of UNK-461 and ate it 
 with his UNK-494 . he had been told that UNK-461 was a capital thing for 
 the blood and he was just then under doctors care . mrs . UNK-130 who had 
 been silent all through the UNK-255 said that her son was going down to 
 mount UNK-319 in a week or so . the table then spoke of mount UNK-319 
 how UNK-436 the air was down there how UNK-688 the UNK-406 were and 
 how they never asked for a UNK-23 from their guests . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and do you mean to say " UNK-0 asked mr . UNK-78 UNK-840 UNK-0 " that a UNK-26 
 can go down there and put up there as if it were a hotel and live on the 
 fat of the land and then come away without paying anything ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o most people give some donation to the UNK-636 when they leave . " UNK-0 
 said mary jane . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i wish we had an institution like that in our church " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-78 
 UNK-38 . 
 UNK-0 
 he was UNK-647 to hear that the UNK-406 never spoke got up at two in 
 the morning and UNK-613 in their UNK-279 . he asked what they did it for . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " thats the rule of the order " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate UNK-419 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes but why ? " UNK-0 asked mr . UNK-78 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-7 kate repeated that it was the rule that was all . mr . UNK-78 still 
 seemed not to understand . UNK-134 UNK-130 explained to him as best he 
 could that the UNK-406 were trying to make up for the UNK-104 committed by 
 all the UNK-608 in the outside world . the explanation was not very clear 
 for mr . UNK-78 UNK-629 and said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i like that idea very much but UNK-9 a comfortable spring bed do 
 them as well as a UNK-142 ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " the UNK-142 " UNK-0 said mary jane UNK-0 " is to remind them of their last end . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 as the subject had grown UNK-542 it was buried in a silence of the 
 table during which mrs . UNK-130 could be heard saying to her UNK-379 in 
 an UNK-398 UNK-286 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " they are very good men the UNK-406 very UNK-290 men . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-29 and UNK-657 and UNK-391 and UNK-607 and UNK-725 and UNK-647 
 and UNK-240 were now passed about the table and UNK-7 julia invited all 
 the guests to have either port or UNK-128 . at first mr . UNK-334 UNK-184 
 refused to take either but one of his UNK-611 UNK-377 him and 
 UNK-222 something to him upon which he allowed his glass to be filled . 
 gradually as the last glasses were being filled the conversation 
 UNK-167 . a UNK-242 followed broken only by the noise of the wine and by 
 UNK-93 of chairs . the UNK-65 UNK-568 all three looked down at 
 the UNK-275 . someone UNK-137 once or twice and then a few UNK-32 
 UNK-788 the table gently as a signal for silence . the silence came and 
 gabriel pushed back his chair . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-700 at once grew UNK-339 in UNK-2 and then UNK-167 
 UNK-537 . gabriel UNK-122 his ten UNK-178 fingers on the UNK-275 
 and UNK-24 UNK-409 at the company . meeting a row of UNK-161 faces he 
 raised his eyes to the UNK-164 . the piano was playing a UNK-579 tune 
 and he could hear the skirts UNK-31 against the UNK-411 door . 
 people perhaps were standing in the snow on the UNK-118 outside UNK-248 
 up at the UNK-340 windows and listening to the UNK-579 music . the air was 
 pure there . in the distance lay the park where the trees were weighted 
 with snow . the wellington UNK-471 UNK-71 a UNK-494 cap of snow that 
 UNK-179 UNK-501 over the white field of fifteen acres . 
 UNK-0 
 he began 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ladies and UNK-32 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " it has fallen to my lot this evening as in years past to perform a 
 very UNK-238 task but a task for which i am afraid my poor powers as a 
 speaker are all too UNK-939 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no no ! " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-78 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but however that may be i can only ask you tonight to take the will 
 for the UNK-448 and to UNK-545 me your attention for a few moments while 
 i UNK-290 to express to you in words what my feelings are on this 
 occasion . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ladies and UNK-32 it is not the first time that we have gathered 
 together under this UNK-688 roof around this UNK-688 board . it is 
 not the first time that we have been the UNK-611 perhaps i had 
 better say the UNK-675 the hospitality of certain good ladies . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he made a circle in the air with his arm and UNK-214 . everyone UNK-20 or 
 UNK-24 at UNK-7 kate and UNK-7 julia and mary jane who all turned UNK-962 
 with pleasure . gabriel went on more UNK-258 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i feel more strongly with every UNK-701 year that our country has 
 no tradition which does it so much UNK-88 and which it should guard so 
 UNK-198 as that of its hospitality . it is a tradition that is unique 
 as far as my experience goes and i have visited not a few places 
 abroad among the modern nations . some would say perhaps that with us 
 it is rather a failing than anything to be UNK-531 of . but granted even 
 that it is to my mind a UNK-743 failing and one that i trust will 
 long be UNK-859 among us . of one thing at least i am sure . as long 
 as this one roof UNK-370 the good ladies UNK-550 i wish from my 
 heart it may do so for many and many a long year to UNK-567 tradition 
 of genuine UNK-100 UNK-819 irish hospitality which our 
 UNK-802 have handed down to us and which we in turn must hand down 
 to our UNK-44 is still alive among us . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-656 UNK-208 of UNK-338 ran round the table . it shot through 
 UNK-533 mind that miss UNK-227 was not there and that she had gone away 
 UNK-563 and he said with confidence in himself 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ladies and UNK-32 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " a new generation is growing up in our UNK-619 a generation UNK-126 by 
 new ideas and new principles . it is serious and UNK-696 for 
 these new ideas and its UNK-311 even when it is UNK-415 is i 
 believe in the main UNK-63 . but we are living in a UNK-8 and if 
 i may use the phrase a UNK-83 age and sometimes i fear that 
 this new generation educated or UNK-553 as it is will lack those 
 qualities of humanity of hospitality of UNK-320 UNK-179 which UNK-386 
 to an older day . listening tonight to the names of all those great 
 UNK-63 of the past it seemed to me i must UNK-313 that we were living 
 in a less UNK-769 age . those days might without UNK-163 be 
 called UNK-769 days and if they are gone beyond recall let us hope at 
 least that in UNK-474 such as this we shall still speak of them with 
 pride and UNK-874 still UNK-617 in our hearts the memory of those 
 dead and gone great ones whose fame the world will not UNK-39 let 
 die . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " hear hear ! " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-78 UNK-76 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but yet " UNK-0 continued gabriel his voice falling into a UNK-43 
 UNK-535 UNK-0 " there are always in UNK-474 such as this UNK-319 thoughts 
 that will UNK-33 to our minds thoughts of the past of youth of 
 changes of absent faces that we miss here tonight . our path through 
 life is UNK-88 with many such sad memories and were we to UNK-771 upon 
 them always we could not find the heart to go on UNK-33 with our work 
 among the living . we have all of us living duties and living UNK-294 
 which claim and UNK-793 claim our UNK-799 UNK-230 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " therefore i will not UNK-552 on the past . i will not let any UNK-484 
 UNK-502 UNK-811 upon us here tonight . here we are gathered together 
 for a brief moment from the UNK-527 and rush of our everyday routine . 
 we are met here as friends in the spirit of UNK-19 as 
 colleagues also to a certain extent in the true spirit of UNK-922 
 and as the guests UNK-364 shall i call them UNK-404 three UNK-799 of the 
 dublin musical world . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the table burst into UNK-541 and UNK-31 at this UNK-858 . UNK-7 julia 
 UNK-501 asked each of her UNK-611 in turn to tell her what gabriel had 
 said . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " he says we are the three UNK-799 UNK-7 julia " UNK-0 said mary jane . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-7 julia did not understand but she looked up UNK-21 at gabriel 
 who continued in the same UNK-249 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " ladies and UNK-32 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i will not attempt to play tonight the part that paris played on 
 another occasion . i will not attempt to choose between them . the task 
 would be an UNK-920 one and one beyond my poor powers . for when i view 
 them in turn whether it be our chief UNK-865 herself whose good heart 
 whose too good heart has become a UNK-110 with all who know her or her 
 sister who seems to be UNK-836 with UNK-761 youth and whose singing 
 must have been a surprise and a revelation to us all tonight or last 
 but not least when i consider our UNK-55 UNK-865 talented UNK-217 
 UNK-389 and the best of UNK-536 i UNK-313 ladies and UNK-32 
 that i do not know to which of them i should award the prize . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel UNK-75 down at his UNK-37 and seeing the large smile on UNK-7 
 UNK-468 face and the tears which had UNK-482 to UNK-7 UNK-561 eyes UNK-407 
 to his close . he raised his glass of port UNK-37 while every member 
 of the company UNK-863 a glass UNK-630 and said UNK-76 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " let us UNK-550 them all three together . let us drink to their health 
 wealth long life happiness and UNK-532 and may they long continue 
 to hold the proud and UNK-880 position which they hold in their 
 profession and the position of UNK-88 and UNK-874 which they hold in 
 our hearts . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 all the guests stood up glass in hand and turning towards the three 
 UNK-154 ladies UNK-57 in UNK-376 with mr . UNK-78 as leader 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 for they are UNK-236 gay UNK-13 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 for they are UNK-236 gay UNK-13 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 for they are UNK-236 gay UNK-13 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 which nobody can deny . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-7 kate was making frank use of her UNK-185 and even UNK-7 julia 
 seemed moved . UNK-134 UNK-130 beat time with his UNK-382 and the 
 UNK-63 turned towards one another as if in UNK-952 conference while 
 they UNK-57 with emphasis 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 unless he tells a lie 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 unless he tells a lie . 
 UNK-0 
 then turning once more towards their UNK-280 they UNK-57 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 for they are UNK-236 gay UNK-13 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 for they are UNK-236 gay UNK-13 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 for they are UNK-236 gay UNK-13 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 which nobody can deny . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-434 which followed was taken up beyond the door of the 
 UNK-131 by many of the other guests and UNK-201 time after time 
 UNK-134 UNK-130 acting as officer with his fork on high . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-533 morning air came into the hall where they were standing so 
 that UNK-7 kate said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " close the door somebody . mrs . UNK-130 will get her death of cold . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-78 is out there UNK-7 kate " UNK-0 said mary jane . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-78 is everywhere " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate UNK-314 her voice . 
 UNK-0 
 mary jane UNK-20 at her tone . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " really " UNK-0 she said UNK-109 UNK-0 " he is very UNK-308 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " he has been laid on here like the gas " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate in the same 
 tone UNK-0 " all during the christmas . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she UNK-20 herself this time UNK-888 and then added quickly 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but tell him to come in mary jane and close the door . i hope to 
 UNK-403 he UNK-3 hear me . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 at that moment the UNK-581 was opened and mr . UNK-78 came in from the 
 UNK-22 laughing as if his heart would break . he was dressed in a long 
 green UNK-319 with UNK-896 UNK-406 UNK-625 and collar and UNK-71 on his head 
 an oval fur cap . he pointed down the UNK-221 UNK-118 from where the 
 sound of UNK-367 UNK-609 UNK-604 was UNK-618 in . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " teddy will have all the UNK-216 in dublin out " UNK-0 he said . 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel advanced from the little UNK-734 behind the office UNK-875 
 into his UNK-319 and looking round the hall said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-245 not down yet ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-23 getting on her things gabriel " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-169 playing up there ? " UNK-0 asked gabriel . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " nobody . UNK-30 all gone . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o no UNK-7 kate " UNK-0 said mary jane . UNK-0 " UNK-334 UNK-184 and miss UNK-600 
 UNK-602 gone yet . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " someone is UNK-237 at the piano UNK-58 " UNK-0 said gabriel . 
 UNK-0 
 mary jane UNK-75 at gabriel and mr . UNK-78 and said with a UNK-485 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " it makes me feel cold to look at you two UNK-32 UNK-130 up like 
 that . i UNK-9 like to face your journey home at this hour . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " id like nothing better this minute " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-78 UNK-147 UNK-0 " than a 
 UNK-437 fine walk in the country or a fast drive with a good spanking 
 UNK-984 between the UNK-318 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " we used to have a very good horse and trap at home " UNK-0 said UNK-7 julia 
 UNK-542 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " the UNK-163 johnny " UNK-0 said mary jane laughing . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-7 kate and gabriel UNK-20 too . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " why what was wonderful about johnny ? " UNK-0 asked mr . UNK-78 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " the late UNK-167 patrick UNK-568 our UNK-423 that is " UNK-0 explained 
 gabriel UNK-0 " commonly known in his later years as the old gentleman was a 
 UNK-623 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o now gabriel " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate laughing UNK-0 " he had a UNK-227 mill . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well UNK-42 or UNK-227 " UNK-0 said gabriel UNK-0 " the old gentleman had a horse by 
 the name of johnny . and johnny used to work in the old UNK-885 mill 
 walking round and round in order to drive the mill . that was all very 
 well but now comes the UNK-472 part about johnny . one fine day the old 
 gentleman thought UNK-25 like to drive out with the quality to a military 
 review in the park . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " the lord have mercy on his soul " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate UNK-291 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-294 " UNK-0 said gabriel . UNK-0 " so the old gentleman as i said UNK-931 johnny 
 and put on his very best tall hat and his very best stock collar and 
 drove out in grand style from his UNK-791 UNK-229 somewhere near back 
 lane i think . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 everyone UNK-20 even mrs . UNK-130 at UNK-533 manner and UNK-7 kate 
 said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o now gabriel he UNK-3 live in back lane really . only the mill was 
 there . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " out from the UNK-229 of his UNK-802 " UNK-0 continued gabriel UNK-0 " he drove 
 with johnny . and everything went on beautifully until johnny came in 
 sight of king UNK-958 UNK-287 and whether he fell in love with the horse 
 king billy UNK-805 on or whether he thought he was back again in the mill 
 UNK-58 he began to walk round the UNK-287 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel UNK-771 in a circle round the hall in his UNK-527 UNK-22 the 
 UNK-31 of the others . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " round and round he went " UNK-0 said gabriel UNK-0 " and the old gentleman who was 
 a very UNK-382 old gentleman was highly UNK-94 . go on sir ! what 
 do you mean sir ? johnny ! johnny ! most extraordinary conduct ! cant 
 understand the horse ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-909 of UNK-31 which followed UNK-533 UNK-298 of the incident 
 was UNK-9 by a UNK-403 knock at the hall door . mary jane ran to 
 open it and let in UNK-134 UNK-130 . UNK-134 UNK-130 with his hat well back 
 on his head and his UNK-61 UNK-328 with cold was UNK-20 and UNK-467 
 after his UNK-530 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i could only get one cab " UNK-0 he said . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o well find another along the UNK-118 " UNK-0 said gabriel . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate . UNK-0 " better not keep mrs . UNK-130 standing in the 
 UNK-643 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 mrs . UNK-130 was helped down the front steps by her son and mr . UNK-78 
 and after many UNK-933 UNK-605 into the cab . UNK-134 UNK-130 
 UNK-655 in after her and spent a long time UNK-571 her on the seat 
 mr . UNK-78 helping him with advice . at last she was settled UNK-416 
 and UNK-134 UNK-130 invited mr . UNK-78 into the cab . there was a good 
 deal of confused talk and then mr . UNK-78 got into the cab . the UNK-380 
 settled his rug over his UNK-111 and bent down for the address . the 
 confusion grew greater and the UNK-380 was directed differently by UNK-134 
 UNK-130 and mr . UNK-78 each of whom had his head out through a window of 
 the cab . the difficulty was to know where to drop mr . UNK-78 along the 
 route and UNK-7 kate UNK-7 julia and mary jane helped the discussion 
 from the UNK-22 with UNK-608 and UNK-517 and UNK-214 
 of UNK-31 . as for UNK-134 UNK-130 he was UNK-976 with UNK-31 . 
 he UNK-388 his head in and out of the window every moment to the 
 great danger of his hat and told his mother how the discussion was 
 UNK-692 till at last mr . UNK-78 UNK-247 to the UNK-270 UNK-380 
 above the UNK-595 of UNK-346 UNK-31 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " do you know trinity college ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes sir " UNK-0 said the UNK-380 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well drive bang up against trinity college gates " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-78 
 UNK-0 " and then well tell you where to go . you understand now ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes sir " UNK-0 said the UNK-380 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " make like a bird for trinity college . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " right sir " UNK-0 said the UNK-380 . 
 UNK-0 
 the horse was UNK-628 up and the cab UNK-590 off along the UNK-118 UNK-22 a 
 chorus of UNK-31 and UNK-781 . 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel had not gone to the door with the others . he was in a dark part 
 of the hall UNK-248 up the UNK-116 . a woman was standing near the top 
 of the first flight in the shadow also . he could not see her face but 
 he could see the UNK-180 and UNK-308 panels of her skirt which 
 the shadow made appear black and white . it was his wife . she was UNK-200 
 on the UNK-442 listening to something . gabriel was surprised at her 
 UNK-87 and UNK-434 his ear to listen also . but he could hear little 
 save the noise of UNK-31 and dispute on the front steps a few UNK-362 
 struck on the piano and a few notes of a UNK-54 voice singing . 
 UNK-0 
 he stood still in the UNK-286 of the hall trying to catch the air that 
 the voice was singing and UNK-248 up at his wife . there was grace and 
 mystery in her attitude as if she were a symbol of something . he asked 
 himself what is a woman standing on the UNK-93 in the shadow listening 
 to distant music a symbol of . if he were a UNK-554 he would paint her 
 in that attitude . her blue felt hat would show off the bronze of her 
 hair against the darkness and the dark panels of her skirt would show 
 off the light ones . distant music he would call the picture if he were a 
 UNK-554 . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-581 was closed and UNK-7 kate UNK-7 julia and mary jane came 
 down the hall still laughing . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well UNK-50 UNK-134 terrible ? " UNK-0 said mary jane . UNK-0 " UNK-2 really terrible . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel said nothing but pointed up the UNK-93 towards where his wife 
 was standing . now that the UNK-581 was closed the voice and the piano 
 could be heard more clearly . gabriel held up his hand for them to be 
 silent . the song seemed to be in the old irish UNK-630 and the singer 
 seemed UNK-481 both of his words and of his voice . the voice 
 made UNK-838 by distance and by the UNK-63 UNK-47 UNK-284 
 UNK-300 the UNK-435 of the air with words UNK-65 UNK-383 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  o the rain falls on my heavy locks 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  and the UNK-826 UNK-718 my skin 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  my babe lies cold . . . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o " UNK-0 UNK-751 mary jane . UNK-0 " its UNK-334 UNK-184 singing and he UNK-9 
 sing all the night . o ill get him to sing a song before he goes . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o do mary jane " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate . 
 UNK-0 
 mary jane UNK-30 past the others and ran to the UNK-116 but before 
 she reached it the singing stopped and the piano was closed UNK-740 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o what a UNK-47 ! " UNK-0 she UNK-5 . UNK-0 " is he coming down UNK-245 ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel heard his wife answer yes and saw her come down towards them . a 
 few steps behind her were mr . UNK-334 UNK-184 and miss UNK-600 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o mr . UNK-184 " UNK-0 UNK-5 mary jane UNK-0 " its UNK-576 mean of you to break 
 off like that when we were all in UNK-742 listening to you . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i have been at him all the evening " UNK-0 said miss UNK-600 UNK-0 " and mrs . 
 UNK-190 too and he told us he had a UNK-348 cold and UNK-18 sing . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o mr . UNK-184 " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate UNK-0 " now that was a great UNK-581 to tell . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " cant you see that im as UNK-445 as a UNK-936 ? " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-184 roughly . 
 UNK-0 
 he went into the UNK-734 UNK-542 and put on his UNK-319 . the others 
 taken UNK-846 by his UNK-292 speech could find nothing to say . UNK-7 kate 
 UNK-623 her UNK-490 and made signs to the others to drop the subject . mr . 
 UNK-184 stood UNK-734 his neck carefully and UNK-449 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " its the weather " UNK-0 said UNK-7 julia after a UNK-242 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes everybody has UNK-263 " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate readily UNK-0 " everybody . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " they say " UNK-0 said mary jane UNK-0 " we UNK-204 had snow like it for thirty 
 years and i read this morning in the newspapers that the snow is 
 general all over ireland . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i love the look of snow " UNK-0 said UNK-7 julia UNK-542 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " so do i " UNK-0 said miss UNK-600 . UNK-0 " i think christmas is never really 
 christmas unless we have the snow on the ground . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " but poor mr . UNK-184 UNK-55 like the snow " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate UNK-21 . 
 UNK-0 
 mr . UNK-184 came from the UNK-734 fully UNK-492 and UNK-872 and in 
 a UNK-959 tone told them the history of his cold . everyone gave him 
 advice and said it was a great UNK-47 and UNK-318 him to be very careful of 
 his throat in the night air . gabriel watched his wife who did not join 
 in the conversation . she was standing right under the UNK-673 UNK-456 and 
 the flame of the gas lit up the rich bronze of her hair which he had 
 seen her UNK-980 at the fire a few days before . she was in the same 
 attitude and seemed UNK-624 of the talk about her . at last she turned 
 towards them and gabriel saw that there was colour on her UNK-145 and 
 that her eyes were UNK-160 . a sudden tide of joy went UNK-410 out of his 
 heart . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " mr . UNK-184 " UNK-0 she said UNK-0 " what is the name of that song you were 
 singing ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " its called the UNK-341 of UNK-896 " UNK-0 said mr . UNK-184 UNK-0 " but i UNK-18 
 remember it properly . why ? do you know it ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " the UNK-341 of UNK-896 " UNK-0 she repeated . UNK-0 " i UNK-18 think of the name . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " its a very nice air " UNK-0 said mary jane . UNK-0 " im sorry you were not in voice 
 tonight . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " now mary jane " UNK-0 said UNK-7 kate UNK-0 " dont UNK-638 mr . UNK-184 . i UNK-19 have 
 him UNK-776 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 seeing that all were ready to start she UNK-682 them to the door 
 where UNK-274 was said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well UNK-274 UNK-7 kate and thanks for the pleasant evening . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-274 gabriel . UNK-274 UNK-245 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-274 UNK-7 kate and thanks ever so much . UNK-274 UNK-7 julia . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o UNK-274 UNK-245 i UNK-3 see you . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-274 mr . UNK-184 . UNK-274 miss UNK-600 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-274 miss UNK-568 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-274 again . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-274 all . safe home . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-274 . good night . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the morning was still dark . a UNK-66 yellow light UNK-444 over the 
 houses and the river and the sky seemed to be descending . it was UNK-705 
 UNK-432 and only UNK-24 and patches of snow lay on the UNK-170 on 
 the UNK-157 of the UNK-118 and on the area UNK-321 . the lamps were still 
 burning UNK-487 in the UNK-175 air and across the river the palace of the 
 four courts stood out UNK-867 against the heavy sky . 
 UNK-0 
 she was walking on before him with mr . UNK-334 UNK-184 her shoes in a 
 brown parcel UNK-852 under one arm and her hands holding her skirt up 
 from the UNK-524 . she had no longer any grace of attitude but UNK-533 
 eyes were still bright with happiness . the blood went UNK-295 along his 
 UNK-692 and the thoughts went UNK-371 through his brain proud UNK-71 
 tender UNK-253 . 
 UNK-0 
 she was walking on before him so UNK-79 and so UNK-705 that he UNK-405 to 
 run after her UNK-963 catch her by the UNK-61 and say something 
 UNK-735 and UNK-167 into her ear . she seemed to him so UNK-422 that 
 he UNK-405 to defend her against something and then to be alone with her . 
 moments of their secret life together burst like stars upon his memory . 
 a UNK-549 envelope was lying beside his UNK-880 and he was 
 UNK-539 it with his hand . birds were UNK-236 in the UNK-390 and the 
 sunny web of the UNK-622 was UNK-459 along the floor he could not 
 eat for happiness . they were standing on the UNK-196 platform and he was 
 placing a ticket inside the warm palm of her UNK-516 . he was standing 
 with her in the cold looking in through a UNK-892 window at a man making 
 bottles in a UNK-710 UNK-642 . it was very cold . her face UNK-23 in 
 the cold air was quite close to his and suddenly he called out to the 
 man at the UNK-642 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " is the fire hot sir ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 but the man could not hear with the noise of the UNK-642 . it was just as 
 well . he might have answered UNK-394 . 
 UNK-0 
 a wave of yet more tender joy UNK-525 from his heart and went UNK-500 
 in warm flood along his UNK-590 . like the tender fire of stars moments 
 of their life together that no one knew of or would ever know of broke 
 upon and UNK-872 his memory . he UNK-405 to recall to her those moments 
 to make her forget the years of their UNK-66 existence together and 
 remember only their moments of UNK-119 . for the years he felt had not 
 UNK-56 his soul or UNK-349 . their children his writing her household 
 UNK-89 had not UNK-56 all their souls tender fire . in one letter that 
 he had written to her then he had said UNK-0 " why is it that words like 
 these seem to me so UNK-66 and cold ? is it because there is no word tender 
 enough to be your name ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 like distant music these words that he had written years before were 
 UNK-618 towards him from the past . he UNK-405 to be alone with her . when 
 the others had gone away when he and she were in the room in their hotel 
 then they would be alone together . he would call her UNK-41 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-245 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 perhaps she would not hear at once she would be UNK-808 . then 
 something in his voice would strike her . she would turn and look at 
 him . . . . 
 UNK-0 
 at the corner of UNK-88 street they met a cab . he was glad of its 
 UNK-437 noise as it saved him from conversation . she was looking out of 
 the window and seemed tired . the others spoke only a few words pointing 
 out some building or street . the horse UNK-757 along UNK-853 under the 
 UNK-175 morning sky UNK-873 his old UNK-437 box after his UNK-183 
 and gabriel was again in a cab with her UNK-608 to catch the boat 
 UNK-608 to their UNK-250 . 
 UNK-0 
 as the cab drove across UNK-310 bridge miss UNK-600 said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " they say you never cross UNK-310 bridge without seeing a white 
 horse . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i see a white man this time " UNK-0 said gabriel . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " where ? " UNK-0 asked mr . UNK-334 UNK-184 . 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel pointed to the UNK-287 on which lay patches of snow . then he 
 UNK-146 UNK-108 to it and UNK-234 his hand . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-274 dan " UNK-0 he said UNK-219 . 
 UNK-0 
 when the cab drew up before the hotel gabriel UNK-615 out and in UNK-300 
 of mr . UNK-334 UNK-80 protest paid the driver . he gave the man a 
 UNK-378 over his fare . the man UNK-276 and said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " a UNK-38 new year to you sir . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " the same to you " UNK-0 said gabriel UNK-698 . 
 UNK-0 
 she UNK-122 for a moment on his arm in getting out of the cab and while 
 standing at the UNK-526 bidding the others UNK-274 . she UNK-122 
 UNK-79 on his arm as UNK-79 as when she had UNK-452 with him a few 
 hours before . he had felt proud and happy then happy that she was his 
 proud of her grace and UNK-261 UNK-114 . but now after the UNK-328 
 again of so many memories the first touch of her body musical and 
 strange and UNK-630 sent through him a keen UNK-716 of UNK-431 . under cover 
 of her silence he pressed her arm closely to his side and as they 
 stood at the hotel door he felt that they had UNK-525 from their lives 
 and duties UNK-525 from home and friends and run away together with 
 wild and UNK-543 hearts to a new adventure . 
 UNK-0 
 an old man was UNK-969 in a great UNK-226 chair in the hall . he lit a 
 candle in the office and went before them to the UNK-93 . they followed 
 him in silence their feet falling in soft UNK-135 on the UNK-416 UNK-674 
 UNK-93 . she mounted the UNK-93 behind the porter her head UNK-170 in 
 the UNK-215 her UNK-422 UNK-61 UNK-773 as with a burden her skirt UNK-99 
 UNK-651 about her . he could have UNK-168 his arms about her UNK-40 and held 
 her still for his arms were UNK-178 with desire to UNK-495 her and only 
 the stress of his nails against the UNK-976 of his hands held the wild 
 UNK-231 of his body in check . the porter UNK-46 on the UNK-93 to settle 
 his UNK-155 candle . they UNK-46 too on the steps below him . in the 
 silence gabriel could hear the falling of the UNK-820 wax into the tray 
 and the UNK-512 of his own heart against his UNK-905 . 
 UNK-0 
 the porter led them along a UNK-366 and opened a door . then he set his 
 UNK-670 candle down on a UNK-105 and asked at what hour they were 
 to be called in the morning . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " eight " UNK-0 said gabriel . 
 UNK-0 
 the porter pointed to the tap of the UNK-136 and began a UNK-606 
 UNK-679 but gabriel cut him short . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " we dont want any light . we have light enough from the street . and i 
 say " UNK-0 he added pointing to the candle UNK-0 " you might remove that UNK-218 
 article like a good man . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the porter took up his candle again but slowly for he was surprised by 
 such a novel idea . then he UNK-799 UNK-274 and went out . gabriel shot 
 the lock to . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-675 light from the street lamp lay in a long shaft from one window 
 to the door . gabriel UNK-163 his UNK-319 and hat on a UNK-447 and UNK-112 
 the room towards the window . he looked down into the street in order 
 that his UNK-370 might calm a little . then he turned and UNK-122 against 
 a chest of UNK-440 with his back to the light . she had taken off her hat 
 and UNK-382 and was standing before a large UNK-907 mirror UNK-308 her 
 UNK-599 . gabriel UNK-214 for a few moments watching her and then said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-245 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she turned away from the mirror slowly and walked along the shaft of 
 light towards him . her face looked so serious and UNK-129 that the words 
 would not pass UNK-533 lips . no it was not the moment yet . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " you looked tired " UNK-0 he said . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i am a little " UNK-0 she answered . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " you dont feel ill or weak ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " no tired thats all . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she went on to the window and stood there looking out . gabriel UNK-56 
 again and then UNK-143 that UNK-154 was about to UNK-900 him he 
 said UNK-740 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " by the way UNK-245 ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what is it ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " you know that poor fellow UNK-130 ? " UNK-0 he said quickly . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes . what about him ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well poor fellow UNK-2 a decent sort of UNK-26 after all " UNK-0 continued 
 gabriel in a false voice . UNK-0 " he gave me back that UNK-480 i UNK-256 him 
 and i UNK-3 expect it really . its a UNK-47 he UNK-9 keep away from 
 that UNK-78 because UNK-2 not a bad fellow really . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he was UNK-178 now with UNK-971 . why did she seem so UNK-141 ? he 
 did not know how he could begin . was she UNK-776 too about something ? 
 if she would only turn to him or come to him of her own UNK-882 ! to take 
 her as she was would be brutal . no he must see some UNK-242 in her eyes 
 first . he UNK-405 to be master of her strange mood . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " when did you UNK-545 him the pound ? " UNK-0 she asked after a UNK-242 . 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel UNK-952 to UNK-561 himself from breaking out into brutal 
 language about the UNK-784 UNK-130 and his pound . he UNK-405 to cry to her 
 from his soul to UNK-432 her body against his to UNK-601 her . but he 
 said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o at christmas when he opened that little UNK-204 shop in 
 henry street . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he was in such a fever of rage and desire that he did not hear her come 
 from the window . she stood before him for an instant looking at him 
 UNK-784 . then suddenly raising herself on UNK-649 and UNK-807 her 
 hands UNK-79 on his UNK-61 she UNK-166 him . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " you are a very generous person gabriel " UNK-0 she said . 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel UNK-178 with delight at her sudden kiss and at the UNK-944 
 of her phrase put his hands on her hair and began UNK-899 it back 
 UNK-253 UNK-358 it with his fingers . the washing had made it fine and 
 brilliant . his heart was UNK-296 over with happiness . just when he 
 was wishing for it she had come to him of her own UNK-882 . perhaps her 
 thoughts had been running with his . perhaps she had felt the UNK-801 
 desire that was in him and then the UNK-76 mood had come upon her . 
 now that she had fallen to him so easily he UNK-105 why he had been so 
 UNK-218 . 
 UNK-0 
 he stood holding her head between his hands . then UNK-851 one arm 
 UNK-171 about her body and drawing her towards him he said UNK-41 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " UNK-245 dear what are you thinking about ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she did not answer nor yield UNK-571 to his arm . he said again UNK-41 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " tell me what it is UNK-245 . i think i know what is the matter . do i 
 know ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she did not answer at once . then she said in an UNK-256 of tears 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o i am thinking about that song the UNK-341 of UNK-896 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she broke loose from him and ran to the bed and throwing her arms 
 across the UNK-661 UNK-373 her face . gabriel stood UNK-969 for a moment 
 in UNK-944 and then followed her . as he passed in the way of the 
 UNK-616 he caught sight of himself in full length his broad 
 UNK-170 UNK-790 the face whose expression always UNK-555 him 
 when he saw it in a mirror and his UNK-137 UNK-398 UNK-471 . 
 he UNK-46 a few UNK-474 from her and said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what about the song ? why does that make you cry ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she raised her head from her arms and dried her eyes with the back of 
 her hand like a child . a UNK-53 note than he had intended went into his 
 voice . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " why UNK-245 ? " UNK-0 he asked . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i am thinking about a person long ago who used to sing that song . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and who was the person long ago ? " UNK-0 asked gabriel UNK-21 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " it was a person i used to know in UNK-553 when i was living with my 
 UNK-933 " UNK-0 she said . 
 UNK-0 
 the smile passed away from UNK-533 face . a UNK-66 anger began to gather 
 again at the back of his mind and the UNK-66 fires of his UNK-431 began to 
 glow UNK-551 in his UNK-692 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " someone you were in love with ? " UNK-0 he asked UNK-496 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " it was a young boy i used to know " UNK-0 she answered UNK-0 " named michael UNK-739 . 
 he used to sing that song the UNK-341 of UNK-896 . he was very UNK-325 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel was silent . he did not wish her to think that he was interested 
 in this UNK-325 boy . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i can see him so UNK-722 " UNK-0 she said after a moment . UNK-0 " such eyes as he 
 had big dark eyes ! and such an expression in UNK-291 expression ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " o then you are in love with him ? " UNK-0 said gabriel . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i used to go out walking with him " UNK-0 she said UNK-0 " when i was in UNK-553 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 a thought UNK-230 across UNK-533 mind . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " perhaps that was why you wanted to go to UNK-553 with that UNK-227 girl ? " UNK-0 
 he said UNK-482 . 
 UNK-0 
 she looked at him and asked in surprise 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what for ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 her eyes made gabriel feel UNK-795 . he UNK-57 his UNK-61 and said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " how do i know ? to see him perhaps . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she looked away from him along the shaft of light towards the window in 
 silence . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " he is dead " UNK-0 she said at length . UNK-0 " he died when he was only UNK-538 . 
 UNK-50 it a terrible thing to die so young as that ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " what was he ? " UNK-0 asked gabriel still UNK-496 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " he was in the UNK-875 " UNK-0 she said . 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel felt UNK-8 by the failure of his UNK-913 and by the UNK-392 
 of this figure from the dead a boy in the UNK-875 . while he had been 
 full of memories of their secret life together full of UNK-145 and 
 joy and desire she had been comparing him in her mind with another . a 
 UNK-402 consciousness of his own person UNK-711 him . he saw himself 
 as a UNK-470 figure acting as a UNK-989 for his UNK-37 a nervous 
 UNK-920 UNK-671 UNK-431 to UNK-420 and UNK-203 his 
 own UNK-530 UNK-101 the UNK-944 UNK-710 fellow he had caught a UNK-332 
 of in the mirror . UNK-186 he turned his back more to the light 
 UNK-689 she might see the shame that UNK-416 upon his UNK-133 . 
 UNK-0 
 he tried to keep up his tone of cold UNK-289 but his voice when 
 he spoke was UNK-369 and UNK-942 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i suppose you were in love with this michael UNK-739 UNK-245 " UNK-0 he said . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i was great with him at that time " UNK-0 she said . 
 UNK-0 
 her voice was UNK-585 and sad . gabriel feeling now how UNK-398 it would be 
 to try to lead her UNK-481 he had UNK-493 UNK-349 one of her hands 
 and said also UNK-542 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and what did he die of so young UNK-245 ? consumption was it ? " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i think he died for me " UNK-0 she answered . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-209 terror UNK-457 gabriel at this answer as if at that hour when 
 he had hoped to triumph some UNK-378 and UNK-178 being was coming 
 against him gathering forces against him in its UNK-209 world . but he 
 UNK-35 himself free of it with an effort of reason and continued to 
 UNK-806 her hand . he did not question her again for he felt that she 
 would tell him of herself . her hand was warm and UNK-295 it did not 
 respond to his touch but he continued to UNK-806 it just as he had 
 UNK-349 her first letter to him that spring morning . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " it was in the winter " UNK-0 she said UNK-0 " about the beginning of the winter 
 when i was going to leave my UNK-915 and come up here to the 
 UNK-575 . and he was ill at the time in his UNK-671 in UNK-553 and 
 UNK-9 be let out and his people in UNK-777 were written to . 
 he was in decline they said or something like that . i never knew 
 UNK-793 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she UNK-214 for a moment and UNK-279 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " poor fellow " UNK-0 she said . UNK-0 " he was very UNK-345 of me and he was such a 
 gentle boy . we used to go out together walking you know gabriel like 
 the way they do in the country . he was going to study singing only for 
 his health . he had a very good voice poor michael UNK-739 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " well and then ? " UNK-0 asked gabriel . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and then when it came to the time for me to leave UNK-553 and come up to 
 the UNK-575 he was much worse and i UNK-9 be let see him so i wrote 
 him a letter saying i was going up to dublin and would be back in the 
 summer and hoping he would be better then . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she UNK-214 for a moment to get her voice under control and then went 
 on 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " then the night before i left i was in my UNK-915 house in UNK-71 
 island packing up and i heard UNK-59 thrown up against the window . 
 the window was so wet i UNK-18 see so i ran UNK-627 as i was and 
 UNK-728 out the back into the garden and there was the poor fellow at 
 the end of the garden UNK-384 . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and did you not tell him to go back ? " UNK-0 asked gabriel . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " i UNK-309 of him to go home at once and told him he would get his 
 death in the rain . but he said he did not want to live . i can see his 
 eyes as well as well ! he was standing at the end of the wall where there 
 was a tree . " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " and did he go home ? " UNK-0 asked gabriel . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 " yes he went home . and when i was only a week in the UNK-575 he died 
 and he was buried in UNK-777 where his people came from . o the day 
 i heard that that he was dead ! " UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she stopped UNK-553 with UNK-319 and overcome by UNK-370 UNK-168 herself 
 face UNK-874 on the bed UNK-260 in the quilt . gabriel held her hand 
 for a moment longer UNK-997 and then UNK-523 of UNK-907 on her 
 UNK-383 let it fall gently and walked UNK-40 to the window . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 she was fast UNK-314 . 
 UNK-0 
 gabriel UNK-200 on his UNK-213 looked for a few moments UNK-688 
 on her UNK-480 hair and UNK-252 mouth listening to her UNK-473 
 breath . so she had had that romance in her life a man had died for her 
 sake . it hardly UNK-588 him now to think how poor a part he her husband 
 had played in her life . he watched her while she UNK-613 as though he and 
 she had never lived together as man and wife . his curious eyes UNK-346 
 long upon her face and on her hair and as he thought of what she must 
 have been then in that time of her first UNK-175 beauty a strange 
 friendly UNK-47 for her entered his soul . he did not like to say even to 
 himself that her face was no longer beautiful but he knew that it was 
 no longer the face for which michael UNK-739 had UNK-8 death . 
 UNK-0 
 perhaps she had not told him all the story . his eyes moved to the 
 chair over which she had thrown some of her clothes . a UNK-470 string 
 UNK-139 to the floor . one boot stood UNK-539 its UNK-544 upper fallen 
 down the fellow of it lay upon its side . he UNK-105 at his UNK-306 of 
 emotions of an hour before . from what had it UNK-360 ? from his UNK-37 
 UNK-255 from his own UNK-735 speech from the wine and dancing the 
 UNK-852 when saying UNK-274 in the hall the pleasure of the 
 walk along the river in the snow . poor UNK-7 julia ! she too would soon 
 be a shade with the shade of patrick UNK-568 and his horse . he had 
 caught that UNK-845 look upon her face for a moment when she was singing 
 UNK-655 for the bridal . soon perhaps he would be sitting in that same 
 UNK-411 dressed in black his silk hat on his UNK-111 . the UNK-418 
 would be drawn down and UNK-7 kate would be sitting beside him UNK-273 
 and blowing her nose and telling him how julia had died . he would cast 
 about in his mind for some words that might console her and would find 
 only UNK-201 and UNK-453 ones . yes yes that would happen very soon . 
 UNK-0 
 the air of the room UNK-35 his UNK-61 . he UNK-269 himself 
 UNK-747 along under the sheets and lay down beside his wife . one by 
 one they were all becoming shades . better pass UNK-258 into that other 
 world in the full glory of some passion than UNK-247 and UNK-722 UNK-498 
 with age . he thought of how she who lay beside him had locked in her 
 heart for so many years that image of her lovers eyes when he had told 
 her that he did not wish to live . 
 UNK-0 
 generous tears filled UNK-533 eyes . he had never felt like that 
 himself towards any woman but he knew that such a feeling must be love . 
 the tears gathered more UNK-416 in his eyes and in the partial darkness 
 he UNK-747 he saw the form of a young man standing under a UNK-827 
 tree . other forms were near . his soul had UNK-596 that region where 
 UNK-790 the vast hosts of the dead . he was conscious of but could not 
 UNK-702 their UNK-752 and UNK-225 existence . his own identity was 
 UNK-546 out into a grey UNK-378 world the solid world itself 
 which these dead had one time UNK-671 and lived in was UNK-596 and 
 UNK-552 . 
 UNK-0 
 a few light UNK-361 upon the UNK-899 made him turn to the window . it had begun 
 to snow again . he watched UNK-748 the UNK-538 silver and dark falling 
 UNK-543 against the UNK-963 . the time had come for him to set out on 
 his journey UNK-501 . yes the newspapers were right snow was general 
 all over ireland . it was falling on every part of the dark central 
 plain on the UNK-991 hills falling UNK-41 upon the UNK-628 of allen and 
 UNK-199 UNK-501 UNK-41 falling into the dark UNK-779 shannon waves . 
 it was falling too upon every part of the lonely UNK-339 on the 
 hill where michael UNK-739 lay buried . it lay UNK-416 UNK-31 on the 
 UNK-529 UNK-724 and UNK-543 on the spears of the little gate on 
 the UNK-239 UNK-4 . his soul UNK-300 slowly as he heard the snow falling 
 UNK-284 through the universe and UNK-284 falling like the UNK-385 of

 anxiety in his eyes .

 wind that UNK-135 back to them his brief UNK-678 UNK-155 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-38 who had been laughing UNK-265 walked on beside stephen and 
 said 
 UNK-0 
 we UNK-169 to laugh i suppose . UNK-2 rather UNK-208 . im not a 
 UNK-563 myself that is to say . still his UNK-671 takes the harm out of 
 it somehow UNK-55 it ? what did he call it ? joseph the UNK-473 ? 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-45 of UNK-434 jesus stephen answered . 
 UNK-0 
 o UNK-38 said you have heard it before ? 
 UNK-0 
 three times a day after meals stephen said UNK-54 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-14 not a UNK-563 are you ? UNK-38 asked . i mean a UNK-563 in 
 the narrow sense of the word . creation from nothing and UNK-337 and a 
 personal god . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-6 only one sense of the word it seems to me stephen said . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-38 stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which UNK-914 a 
 green stone . he UNK-418 it open with his thumb and offered it . 
 UNK-0 
 thank you stephen said taking a cigarette . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-38 helped himself and UNK-310 the case to . he put it back in his 
 UNK-541 and took from his UNK-799 a nickel UNK-848 UNK-418 
 it open too and having lit his cigarette held the UNK-600 UNK-676 
 towards stephen in the shell of his hands . 
 UNK-0 
 yes of course he said as they went on again . either you believe 
 or you dont UNK-50 it ? personally i UNK-18 stomach that idea of a 
 personal god . you dont stand for that i suppose ? 
 UNK-0 
 you UNK-972 in me stephen said with UNK-771 UNK-75 a horrible 
 example of free thought . 
 UNK-0 
 he walked on waiting to be spoken to UNK-184 his UNK-194 by his 
 side . its UNK-145 followed UNK-79 on the path UNK-12 at his UNK-183 . 
 my familiar after me calling UNK-536 ! a UNK-546 line 
 along the path . they will walk on it tonight coming here in the dark . 
 he wants that key . it is mine . i paid the rent . now i eat his salt 
 bread . give him the key too . all . he will ask for it . that was in his 
 eyes . 
 UNK-0 
 after all UNK-38 began . . . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen turned and saw that the cold UNK-49 which had measured him was not 
 all UNK-892 . 
 UNK-0 
 after all i should think you are able to free yourself . you are your 
 own master it seems to me . 
 UNK-0 
 i am a UNK-363 of two masters stephen said an english and an 
 italian . 
 UNK-0 
 italian ? UNK-38 said . 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 and a third stephen said there is who wants me for odd jobs . 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 the imperial british state stephen answered his colour rising and 
 the holy roman catholic and UNK-996 church . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-38 UNK-489 from his UNK-935 some UNK-484 of tobacco before he 
 spoke . 
 UNK-0 
 i can quite understand that he said UNK-331 . an UNK-843 must think 
 like that i UNK-48 . we feel in england that we have treated you rather 
 UNK-800 . it seems history is to blame . 
 UNK-0 
 the proud UNK-866 titles UNK-378 over UNK-8 memory the triumph 
 of their UNK-271 UNK-215 et UNK-709 UNK-689 UNK-505 et UNK-362 
 UNK-221 the slow growth and change of UNK-11 and UNK-351 like his own 
 rare thoughts a chemistry of stars . symbol of the UNK-426 in the 
 mass for pope UNK-377 the voices UNK-507 singing alone loud in 
 UNK-130 and behind their UNK-223 the UNK-521 angel of the church 
 UNK-621 UNK-955 and UNK-148 her UNK-930 . a UNK-393 of UNK-939 
 UNK-488 with UNK-116 UNK-764 UNK-170 and the UNK-771 of UNK-513 of

 UNK-774 of the son with the father and valentine UNK-921 
 UNK-244 UNK-120 body and the subtle african UNK-174 UNK-1 who 
 held that the father was himself his own son . words UNK-4 had spoken 
 a moment since in UNK-756 to the stranger . idle UNK-756 . the void 
 UNK-754 surely all them that UNK-759 the wind a UNK-254 a UNK-527 and a 
 UNK-454 from those UNK-669 angels of the church UNK-154 host 
 who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their UNK-369 and their 
 UNK-145 .

 UNK-0 
 two men stood at the UNK-762 of the cliff watching UNK-404 UNK-394 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-23 making for UNK-598 harbour . 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 UNK-80 UNK-450 .

 UNK-775 far out on the water round .

 UNK-0 
 the boys blank face asked the blank window . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-536 by the daughters of memory . and yet it was in some way if not as 
 memory UNK-536 it . a phrase then of UNK-70 UNK-99 of UNK-687 wings 
 of excess . i hear the UNK-625 of all space UNK-155 glass and UNK-525 
 UNK-476 and time one UNK-460 final flame . whats left us then ? 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 UNK-492 stephen said UNK-220 at the name and date in the 
 UNK-63 book . 
 UNK-0 
 yes sir . and he said another victory like that and we are done 
 for . 
 UNK-0 
 that phrase the world had remembered . a UNK-66 ease of the mind . from 
 a hill above a UNK-615 plain a general speaking to his officers 
 UNK-122 upon his UNK-99 . any general to any officers . they UNK-545 ear . 
 UNK-0 
 you armstrong stephen said . what was the end of UNK-457 ?

 UNK-0 
 i know sir . ask me sir UNK-995 said . 
 UNK-0 
 wait . you armstrong . do you know anything about UNK-457 ? 
 UNK-0 
 a bag of UNK-372 lay UNK-209 in UNK-949 UNK-89 . he UNK-827 them 
 between his UNK-976 at UNK-975 and UNK-368 them UNK-41 . UNK-936 UNK-907 to 
 the tissue of his lips . a UNK-586 boys breath . UNK-357 people proud 
 that their UNK-904 son was in the navy . UNK-416 road UNK-54 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-457 sir ? UNK-457 a UNK-108 . 
 UNK-0 
 all UNK-20 . UNK-909 high UNK-426 UNK-31 . armstrong looked round 
 at his UNK-192 silly UNK-401 in profile . in a moment they will laugh 
 more UNK-76 aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their UNK-490 pay . 
 UNK-0 
 tell me now stephen said UNK-688 the boys shoulder with the book 
 what is a UNK-108 . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-108 sir armstrong said . a thing out in the water . a kind of a 
 bridge . UNK-894 UNK-108 sir . 
 UNK-0 
 some UNK-20 again UNK-909 but with meaning . two in the back bench 
 UNK-222 . yes . they knew had never learned nor ever been innocent . 
 all . with UNK-934 he watched their faces UNK-83 UNK-38 UNK-52 UNK-246 . their 
 likes their UNK-668 too UNK-586 with tea and jam their bracelets 
 UNK-472 in the struggle . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-894 UNK-108 stephen said . yes a disappointed bridge . 
 UNK-0 
 the words UNK-371 their UNK-49 . 
 UNK-0 
 how sir ? UNK-995 asked . a bridge is across a river . 
 UNK-0 
 for UNK-163 UNK-968 . UNK-159 here to hear . tonight UNK-765 UNK-22 wild 
 drink and talk to pierce the polished mail of his mind . what then ? a 
 UNK-326 at the court of his master UNK-16 and UNK-516 winning a 
 UNK-388 masters praise . why had they chosen all that part ? not UNK-571 
 for the smooth UNK-806 . for them too history was a tale like any other 
 too often heard their land a UNK-100 . 
 UNK-0 
 had UNK-457 not fallen by a UNK-940 hand in UNK-349 or UNK-734 UNK-856 not 
 been UNK-166 to death . they are not to be thought away . time has 
 UNK-23 them and UNK-608 they are UNK-15 in the room of the infinite 
 possibilities they have UNK-380 . but can those have been possible seeing 
 that they never were ? or was that only possible which came to pass ? 
 UNK-759 UNK-555 of the wind . 
 UNK-0 
 tell us a story sir . 
 UNK-0 
 o do sir . a UNK-446 . 
 UNK-0 
 where do you begin in this ? stephen asked opening another book . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-955 no more UNK-995 said . 
 UNK-0 
 go on then UNK-548 . 
 UNK-0 
 and the story sir ? 
 UNK-0 
 after stephen said . go on UNK-548 . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-64 boy opened a book and UNK-973 it UNK-901 under the UNK-188 
 of his UNK-89 . he UNK-473 UNK-708 of verse with odd UNK-26 at the text 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 UNK-955 no more UNK-532 UNK-213 UNK-955 no more 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 for UNK-164 your UNK-234 is not dead 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 UNK-796 though he be beneath the UNK-138 floor . . . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 it must be a movement then an UNK-226 of the possible as possible . 
 UNK-169 phrase formed itself within the UNK-347 UNK-351 and UNK-973 
 out into the UNK-239 silence of the library of saint UNK-84 where he 
 had read UNK-410 from the sin of paris night by night . by his UNK-213 
 a UNK-325 UNK-456 UNK-121 a handbook of strategy . fed and feeding UNK-439 
 about me under UNK-620 UNK-159 with UNK-284 UNK-570 UNK-471 and 
 in my minds darkness a UNK-830 of the UNK-772 UNK-258 UNK-523 of 
 UNK-831 UNK-902 her dragon UNK-446 UNK-47 . thought is the thought of 
 thought . UNK-263 UNK-831 . the soul is in a manner all that is the 
 soul is the form of forms . UNK-505 sudden vast UNK-622 form of 
 forms . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-548 repeated 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 through the dear might of him that walked the waves 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 through the dear might . . . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 turn over stephen said UNK-40 . i dont see anything . 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 his hand turned the page over . he UNK-122 back and went on again having 
 just remembered . of him that walked the waves . here also over these 
 UNK-526 hearts his shadow lies and on the UNK-494 heart and lips and 
 on mine . it lies upon their UNK-44 faces who offered him a coin of the 
 tribute . to UNK-856 what is UNK-688 to god what is gods . a long 
 look from dark eyes a UNK-630 sentence to be UNK-240 and UNK-240 on the 
 UNK-235 UNK-121 . UNK-42 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 UNK-810 me UNK-810 me randy ro . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 my father gave me seeds to UNK-840 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-548 UNK-712 his closed book into his UNK-89 . 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 yes sir . hockey at ten sir . 
 UNK-0 
 half day sir . thursday . 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 they UNK-448 their books away UNK-786 UNK-106 pages UNK-245 . 
 UNK-135 together they UNK-492 and UNK-989 their UNK-999 all UNK-282 
 UNK-219 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-810 sir ? ask me sir . 
 UNK-0 
 o ask me sir . 
 UNK-0 
 a hard one sir . 
 UNK-0 
 this is the UNK-810 stephen said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 the cock crew 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 the sky was blue 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 the UNK-215 in heaven 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 were striking eleven . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 UNK-446 time for this poor soul 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 to go to heaven . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 what is that ? 
 UNK-0 
 what sir ? 
 UNK-0 
 again sir . we UNK-3 hear . 
 UNK-0 
 their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated . after a silence 
 UNK-56 said 
 UNK-0 
 what is it sir ? we give it up . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen his throat UNK-508 answered 
 UNK-0 
 the fox UNK-866 his UNK-933 under a UNK-612 . 
 UNK-0 
 he stood up and gave a UNK-668 of nervous UNK-31 to which their UNK-155 
 UNK-131 UNK-319 . 
 UNK-0 
 a stick struck the door and a voice in the UNK-366 called 
 UNK-0 
 hockey ! 
 UNK-0 
 they broke UNK-742 UNK-119 out of their UNK-674 UNK-410 them . quickly 
 they were gone and from the UNK-985 came the UNK-320 of sticks and 
 UNK-216 of their boots and UNK-591 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-703 who alone had UNK-668 came forward slowly showing an open 
 UNK-721 . his thick hair and UNK-361 neck gave witness of UNK-619 
 and through his UNK-684 glasses weak eyes looked up UNK-142 . on his 
 UNK-139 UNK-66 and UNK-934 a soft UNK-103 of ink lay UNK-872 recent 
 and UNK-261 as a UNK-22 bed . 
 UNK-0 
 he held out his UNK-721 . the word UNK-994 was written on the headline . 
 beneath were UNK-576 figures and at the foot a UNK-529 signature with 
 blind loops and a UNK-306 . UNK-368 UNK-703 his name and seal . 
 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-108 told me to write them out all again he said and show them 
 to you sir . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen touched the edges of the book . UNK-233 . 
 UNK-0 
 do you understand how to do them now ? he asked . 
 UNK-0 
 numbers eleven to fifteen UNK-703 answered . mr UNK-108 said i was to 
 copy them off the board sir . 
 UNK-0 
 can you do them yourself ? stephen asked . 
 UNK-0 
 no sir . 
 UNK-0 
 ugly and UNK-931 lean neck and thick hair and a UNK-103 of ink a UNK-22 
 bed . yet someone had loved him UNK-618 him in her arms and in her heart . 
 but for her the race of the world would have UNK-334 him UNK-432 
 a UNK-192 UNK-586 UNK-524 . she had loved his weak UNK-138 blood UNK-962 
 from her own . was that then real ? the only true thing in life ? his 
 mothers UNK-425 body the UNK-163 UNK-6 in holy UNK-432 UNK-409 . 
 she was no more the UNK-178 UNK-232 of a UNK-558 UNK-123 in the fire 
 an UNK-143 of UNK-45 and UNK-108 UNK-460 . she had saved him from being 
 UNK-334 UNK-432 and had gone UNK-253 having been . a poor soul 
 gone to heaven and on a heath beneath UNK-714 stars a fox red UNK-155 
 of UNK-214 in his fur with UNK-698 bright eyes UNK-634 in the earth 
 UNK-126 UNK-634 up the earth UNK-126 UNK-634 and UNK-634 . 
 UNK-0 
 sitting at his side stephen solved out the problem . he UNK-120 by algebra 
 that UNK-892 ghost is UNK-164 UNK-423 . UNK-703 UNK-427 UNK-888 
 through his UNK-368 glasses . UNK-961 UNK-590 in the UNK-985 the 
 hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field . 
 UNK-0 
 across the page the symbols moved in grave UNK-140 in the UNK-280 of 
 their letters wearing UNK-495 caps of UNK-500 and UNK-15 . give hands 
 UNK-792 bow to partner so UNK-538 of fancy of the UNK-496 . gone too from 
 the world UNK-281 and moses UNK-666 dark men in UNK-855 and movement 
 flashing in their UNK-55 mirrors the UNK-960 soul of the world a 
 darkness UNK-160 in UNK-831 which UNK-831 could not UNK-844 . 
 UNK-0 
 do you understand now ? can you work the second for yourself ? 
 UNK-0 
 yes sir . 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 mark my words mr UNK-1 he said . england is in the hands of the 
 jews . in all the highest places her finance her press . and they are 
 the signs of a nations UNK-857 . wherever they gather they eat up the 
 nations vital strength . i have seen it coming these years . as sure 
 as we are standing here the UNK-181 merchants are already at their work of 
 destruction . old england is dying . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-426 UNK-171 off his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a 
 broad UNK-154 . he faced about and back again . 
 UNK-0 
 dying he said again if not dead by now . 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 shall UNK-759 old UNK-867 UNK-379 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 his eyes open wide in vision UNK-156 UNK-867 across the UNK-154 in which 
 he UNK-46 . 
 UNK-0 
 a merchant stephen said is one who buys cheap and sells dear UNK-181 or 
 UNK-362 is he not ? 
 UNK-0 
 they UNK-251 against the light mr UNK-108 said UNK-141 . and you can see 
 the darkness in their eyes . and that is why they are UNK-765 on the 
 earth to this day . 
 UNK-0 
 on the steps of the paris stock exchange the UNK-64 men UNK-309 
 prices on their UNK-376 fingers . UNK-3 of UNK-793 . they UNK-876 loud 
 UNK-576 about the temple their heads UNK-867 under UNK-831 silk 
 hats . not UNK-75 these clothes this speech these UNK-746 . their full 
 slow eyes UNK-665 the words the UNK-746 UNK-44 and UNK-82 but 
 knew the UNK-71 UNK-413 about them and knew their UNK-432 was UNK-398 . UNK-398 
 UNK-435 to UNK-930 and UNK-601 . time surely would UNK-370 all . a UNK-601 
 UNK-574 by the UNK-942 UNK-456 and passing on . their eyes knew their 
 years of UNK-254 and patient knew the UNK-396 of their flesh . 
 UNK-0 
 who has not ? stephen said . 
 UNK-0 
 what do you mean ? mr UNK-108 asked . 
 UNK-0 
 he came forward a pace and stood by the table . his UNK-376 fell 
 UNK-174 open UNK-971 . is this old wisdom ? he UNK-276 to hear from me . 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 from the UNK-911 the boys raised a UNK-668 . a UNK-433 UNK-266 goal . 
 what if that nightmare gave you a back kick ? 
 UNK-0 
 the ways of the creator are not our ways mr UNK-108 said . all human 
 history moves towards one great goal the UNK-393 of god . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-318 his thumb towards the window saying 
 UNK-0 
 that is god . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-511 ! UNK-42 ! UNK-604 !

 UNK-0 
 a UNK-668 in the street stephen answered UNK-250 his UNK-61 . 
 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-108 looked down and held for UNK-401 the wings of his nose UNK-606 
 between his fingers . looking up again he set them free . 
 UNK-0 
 i am UNK-101 than you are he said . we have committed many errors and 
 many UNK-104 . a woman brought sin into the world . for a woman who was no 
 better than she should be helen the UNK-15 wife of UNK-254 ten 
 years the UNK-761 made war on troy . a UNK-226 wife first brought the 
 UNK-76 to our shore here UNK-809 wife and her UNK-582 UNK-849 
 prince of UNK-445 . a woman too brought UNK-121 low . many errors many 
 failures but not the one sin . i am a UNK-463 now at the end of my 
 days . but i will fight for the right till the end . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 for UNK-174 will fight

 after field . holy fields . more room if they buried them standing . 
 sitting or UNK-755 you UNK-18 . standing ? his head might come up some 
 day above ground in a UNK-789 with his hand pointing . all UNK-223

 kind of a UNK-875 . then begin to get black black UNK-78 UNK-516 out of 
 them . then dried up . UNK-919 . of course the cells or whatever they 
 are go on living . changing about . live for ever UNK-82 . nothing to 
 feed on feed on themselves . 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0

 them all it does seem a waste of wood . all UNK-416 through . they could 
 UNK-260 a UNK-218 UNK-458 with a kind of panel UNK-364 let it down that 
 way . UNK-42 but they might object to be buried out of another UNK-13 . 
 UNK-30 so particular . lay me in my native earth . bit of clay from 
 the holy land . only a mother and UNK-353 child ever buried in the one 
 UNK-142 . i see what it means . i see . to protect him as long as possible

 gentle sweet air UNK-299 round the UNK-336 heads in a UNK-365 . UNK-365 . the 
 boy by the UNK-795 held his UNK-927 with both hands UNK-151 UNK-40 in 
 the black open space . mr bloom moved behind the UNK-658 UNK-320 UNK-72 . 
 UNK-247 UNK-423 . UNK-902 them up perhaps to see which will go next . 
 well it is a long rest . feel no more . its the moment you feel . must be

 him in your prayers . even UNK-121 . UNK-390 day dying out . then they follow 
 UNK-794 into a hole one after the other . 
 UNK-0

 not in hell . nice change of air . out of the UNK-900 of life into the

 on the UNK-142 . mr bloom turned away his face . and if he was alive all 
 the time ? UNK-175 ! by UNK-33 that would be awful ! no no he is dead of 
 course . of course he is dead . monday he died . they ought to have 
 some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or 
 a telephone in the UNK-142 and some kind of a canvas UNK-349 . flag of 
 UNK-127 . three days . rather long to keep them in summer . just as well 
 to get shut of them as soon as you are sure UNK-6 no . 
 UNK-0 
 the clay fell UNK-43 . begin to be forgotten . out of sight out of mind . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-72 moved away a few UNK-474 and put on his hat . had enough of 
 it . the UNK-366 took heart of grace one by one covering themselves 
 without show . mr bloom put on his hat and saw the UNK-658 figure make its 
 way UNK-765 through the UNK-39 of UNK-937 . UNK-40 sure of his ground he 
 UNK-319 the UNK-771 fields .

 the UNK-358 . then UNK-442 the blades UNK-79 on the UNK-474 clean . one bent 
 to UNK-397 from the UNK-575 a long UNK-468 of grass . one leaving his UNK-32

 UNK-975 to read a name on a UNK-185 . 
 UNK-0 
 let us go round by the UNK-472 grave UNK-45 said . we have time .

 old UNK-192 hearts and hands . more UNK-629 to spend the money on some

 their own UNK-882 . got the UNK-439 all of them . who UNK-986 the

 UNK-421 . i UNK-699 for cork UNK-989 . i paid five UNK-51 in the 
 pound . or a UNK-95 with her UNK-353 . i cooked good irish UNK-773 .

 UNK-256 and bits of broken UNK-276 on the grave .

 the sacred heart that is showing it . heart on his sleeve . ought to be 
 UNK-174 and red it should be painted like a real heart . ireland was 
 dedicated to it or whatever that . seems anything but pleased . why this 
 UNK-64 ? would birds come then and UNK-915 like the boy with the basket

 UNK-0 
 he would have been on the bench long ago the professor said only for 
 UNK-0 . . . but no matter . 
 UNK-0 
 j . j . UNK-101 turned to stephen and said UNK-40 and slowly 
 UNK-0 
 one of the most polished periods i think i ever UNK-126 to in my life 
 fell from the lips of UNK-479 UNK-784 . it was in that case of UNK-483 
 the UNK-337 murder case . UNK-784 UNK-767 him . and in the UNK-642 of mine 
 ear did pour . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 by the way how did he find that out ? he died in his sleep . or the other 
 story beast with two UNK-116 ? 
 UNK-0 
 what was that ? the professor asked . 
 UNK-0 
 italia UNK-758 UNK-173 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he spoke on the law of evidence j . j . UNK-101 said of roman justice 
 as UNK-408 with the earlier UNK-632 code the UNK-985 UNK-924 . and he 
 cited the moses of UNK-904 in the vatican . 
 UNK-0 
 ha . 
 UNK-0 
 a few UNK-478 words UNK-10 UNK-454 . silence ! 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-242 . j . j . UNK-101 took out his UNK-750 . 
 UNK-0 
 false UNK-841 . something quite ordinary . 
 UNK-0 
 messenger took out his UNK-207 UNK-711 and lit his UNK-455 . 
 UNK-0 
 i have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that 
 it was that small act UNK-168 in itself that striking of that match 
 that determined the whole UNK-540 of both our lives . a polished 
 period 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 j . j . UNK-101 UNK-604 UNK-916 his words 
 UNK-0 
 he said of it that UNK-674 UNK-506 in frozen music UNK-86 and 
 terrible of the human form divine that eternal symbol of wisdom and 
 of UNK-195 which if UNK-461 that the imagination or the hand of UNK-906 
 has UNK-853 in marble of UNK-990 and of UNK-992 
 UNK-988 to live UNK-988 to live . 
 UNK-0 
 his slim hand with a wave UNK-284 echo and fall . 
 UNK-0 
 fine ! UNK-128 crawford said at once . 
 UNK-0 
 the divine UNK-446 mr UNK-206 burke said . 
 UNK-0 
 you like it ? j . j . UNK-101 asked stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen his blood UNK-997 by grace of language and UNK-359 UNK-134 . he 
 took a cigarette from the case . j . j . UNK-101 offered his case to UNK-128 
 crawford . UNK-10 lit their cigarettes as before and took his UNK-24 
 saying 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-854 UNK-437 . 
 UNK-0 
 a man of high UNK-53 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 professor UNK-766 was speaking to me about you j . j . UNK-101 said 
 to stephen . what do you think really of that UNK-8 crowd the UNK-503 
 UNK-218 UNK-485 a . e . the UNK-379 ? that UNK-422 woman started it . 
 she was a nice old bag of tricks . a . e . has been telling some UNK-551 
 UNK-961 that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to 
 ask him about planes of consciousness . UNK-766 thinks you must have 
 been pulling a . e UNK-464 leg . he is a man of the very highest UNK-53 
 UNK-766 . 
 UNK-0 
 speaking about me . what did he say ? what did he say ? what did he say 
 about me ? dont ask . 
 UNK-0 
 no thanks professor UNK-329 said UNK-343 the UNK-750 aside . 
 wait a moment . let me say one thing . the finest display of UNK-771 i 
 ever heard was a speech made by john f taylor at the college historical 
 society . mr justice UNK-23 the present lord justice of appeal had 
 spoken and the paper under debate was an essay new for those days 
 UNK-493 the UNK-35 of the irish tongue . 
 UNK-0 
 he turned towards UNK-128 crawford and said 
 UNK-0 
 you know gerald UNK-23 . then you can imagine the style of his 
 UNK-649 . 
 UNK-0 
 he is sitting with tim UNK-586 j . j . UNK-101 said UNK-390 has it on 
 the trinity college estates commission . 
 UNK-0 
 he is sitting with a sweet thing UNK-128 crawford said in a UNK-337 
 UNK-117 . go on . well ? 
 UNK-0 
 it was the speech mark you the professor said of a finished UNK-241 
 full of UNK-819 UNK-293 and UNK-821 in UNK-150 UNK-195 i will 
 not say the UNK-778 of his UNK-880 but UNK-821 the proud UNK-54 UNK-413 
 upon the new movement . it was then a new movement . we were weak 
 therefore UNK-785 . 
 UNK-0 
 he closed his long thin lips an instant but UNK-44 to be on raised 
 an UNK-966 hand to his UNK-815 and with UNK-178 thumb and 
 UNK-632 UNK-358 UNK-79 the black UNK-226 UNK-740 them to a new 
 focus . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-795 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 in UNK-874 tone he addressed j . j . UNK-101 
 UNK-0 
 taylor had come there you must know from a UNK-146 . that he 
 had prepared his speech i do not believe for there was not even one 
 UNK-96 in the hall . his dark lean face had a growth of UNK-705 
 UNK-153 round it . he UNK-71 a loose white silk UNK-866 and UNK-537 he 
 looked though he was not a dying man . 
 UNK-0 
 his UNK-49 turned at once but slowly from j . j . UNK-431 towards 
 UNK-8 face and then bent at once to the ground seeking . his 
 UNK-172 UNK-683 collar appeared behind his bent head UNK-799 by his 
 UNK-809 hair . still seeking he said 
 UNK-0 
 when UNK-675 speech had ended john f taylor rose to reply . 
 briefly as well as i can bring them to mind his words were these . 
 UNK-0 
 he raised his head UNK-419 . his eyes UNK-175 themselves once more . 
 UNK-459 UNK-149 UNK-318 in the gross lenses to and UNK-161 seeking outlet . 
 UNK-0 
 he began 
 UNK-0 
 mr chairman ladies and UNK-32 great was my UNK-870 in 
 listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of ireland a moment 
 since by my learned friend . it seemed to me that i had been UNK-556 
 into a country far away from this country into an age remote from 
 this age that i stood in ancient egypt and that i was listening to the 
 speech of some UNK-259 of that land addressed to the UNK-405 moses . 
 UNK-0 
 his UNK-797 held their cigarettes UNK-834 to hear their UNK-68 
 UNK-463 in UNK-422 UNK-951 that UNK-644 with his speech . and let our 
 UNK-529 UNK-68 . noble words coming . look out . could you try your hand 
 at it yourself ? 
 UNK-0 
 and it seemed to me that i heard the voice of that egyptian 
 UNK-259 raised in a tone of like UNK-293 and like pride . i heard 
 his words and their meaning was revealed to me . 
 UNK-0 
 from the fathers 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 it was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are UNK-51 
 which neither if they were UNK-88 good nor unless they were good 
 could be UNK-51 . ah UNK-217 you ! thats saint UNK-993 . 
 UNK-0 
 why will you jews not accept our culture our religion and our 
 language ? you are a tribe of UNK-753 UNK-21 we are a mighty people . you 
 have no cities nor no wealth our cities are UNK-758 of humanity and 
 our UNK-841 UNK-740 and UNK-590 laden with all manner merchandise 
 UNK-686 the waters of the known globe . you have but UNK-209 from 
 UNK-902 conditions we have a literature a UNK-117 an UNK-240 
 history and a UNK-607 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-320 . 
 UNK-0 
 child man UNK-506 . 
 UNK-0 
 by the UNK-174 the UNK-58 UNK-456 cradle of UNK-746 a man UNK-823 
 in combat UNK-302 UNK-153 heart of stone . 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 a dumb UNK-463 of hunger UNK-841 his speech . he UNK-64 his voice above it 
 UNK-258 
 UNK-0 
 but ladies and UNK-32 had the UNK-405 moses UNK-126 to and 
 accepted that view of life had he UNK-170 his head and UNK-170 his will 
 and UNK-170 his spirit before that UNK-593 UNK-291 he would never have 
 brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage nor followed 
 the UNK-271 of the cloud by day . he would never have spoken with the 
 eternal UNK-22 UNK-764 on UNK-27 UNK-933 nor ever have come down 
 with the light of inspiration UNK-160 in his UNK-990 and bearing in 
 his arms the tables of the law UNK-715 in the language of the UNK-933 . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-167 and looked at them enjoying a silence . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-700 him ! 
 UNK-0 
 j . j . UNK-101 said not without UNK-675 
 UNK-0 
 and yet he died without having entered the land of promise . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-738 
 UNK-8 UNK-10 added . and with a great future 
 behind him . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-480 of bare feet was heard UNK-531 along the UNK-996 and UNK-908 
 up the UNK-116 .

 on the UNK-563 UNK-335 UNK-838 its UNK-153 board . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-138 UNK-35 UNK-48

 UNK-0 
 mr bloom moved forward raising his UNK-371 eyes . think no more about 
 that . after one . UNK-851 on the UNK-447 is down . UNK-999 time . 
 fascinating little book that is of sir robert balls . UNK-732 . i never 
 exactly understood . UNK-6 a priest . could ask him . par its greek 
 parallel UNK-732 . met him pike UNK-167 she called it till i told her 
 about the UNK-233 . o rocks ! 
 UNK-0 
 mr bloom UNK-24 o rocks at two windows of the UNK-447 . UNK-23 right 
 after all . only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound . 
 UNK-23 not exactly UNK-130 . can be UNK-292 too . UNK-427 out what i was thinking . 
 still i dont know . she used to say ben UNK-72 had a base UNK-70 
 voice . he has legs like UNK-601 and UNK-306 think he was singing into a 
 barrel . now UNK-50 that wit . they used to call him big ben . not half as 
 UNK-130 as calling him base UNK-70 . UNK-437 like an UNK-664 . get 
 outside of a UNK-864 of beef . powerful man he was at UNK-485 away number 
 one bass . barrel of bass . see ? it all works out . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-643 of UNK-451 UNK-295 UNK-982 slowly towards him 
 along the UNK-701 UNK-205 UNK-291 across their boards . bargains . like 
 that priest they are this morning we have UNK-251 we have suffered . he 
 read the UNK-205 letters on their five tall white hats h . e . l . y . s . 
 wisdom UNK-923 . y UNK-232 behind drew a UNK-447 of bread from under his 
 UNK-598 UNK-816 it into his mouth and UNK-279 as he walked . our 
 UNK-192 food . three bob a day walking along the UNK-616 street after 
 street . just keep skin and bone together bread and UNK-185 . they are 
 not UNK-475 no m UNK-18 men . UNK-55 bring in any business either . 
 i suggested to him about a transparent UNK-219 with two smart girls 
 sitting inside writing letters UNK-393 UNK-255 UNK-218 . i 
 bet that would have caught on . smart girls writing something catch the 
 eye at once . everyone dying to know what UNK-23 writing . get twenty of 
 them round you if you UNK-855 at nothing . have a finger in the pie . women

 bare clean UNK-211 waiting in the window of william miller UNK-731

 UNK-741 a pin sometimes come out of the UNK-905 years after tour round the 
 body changing UNK-771 UNK-481 UNK-716 squirting liver UNK-23 juice UNK-887 of

 thought UNK-447 a UNK-283 UNK-187 . handy man wants job . small wages .

 UNK-0 
 mr bloom turned at UNK-570 UNK-131 window of UNK-608 UNK-799 and 
 passed the UNK-140 thomas UNK-546 bookstore . why i left the church 
 of rome ? birds nest . women run him . they say they used to give UNK-563 
 children soup to change to UNK-949 in the time of the potato UNK-402 . 
 society over the way UNK-758 went to for the conversion of poor jews . same 
 UNK-252 . why we left the church of rome . 
 UNK-0 
 a blind UNK-743 stood UNK-451 the UNK-526 with his UNK-293 UNK-330 . no 
 UNK-80 in sight . wants to cross . 
 UNK-0 
 do you want to cross ? mr bloom asked . 
 UNK-0 
 the blind UNK-743 did not answer . his UNK-604 UNK-654 UNK-458 . he 
 moved his head UNK-971 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-14 in UNK-580 street mr bloom said . UNK-946 street is opposite . 
 do you want to cross ? UNK-6 nothing in the way . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-330 moved out UNK-178 to the left . mr UNK-34 eye followed its 
 line and saw again the UNK-672 van drawn up before UNK-262 . where i 
 saw his UNK-613 hair just when i was . horse UNK-17 . driver in 
 john UNK-254 . UNK-24 his UNK-520 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-6 a van there mr bloom said but its not moving . ill see you 
 across . do you want to go to UNK-946 street ? 
 UNK-0 
 yes the UNK-743 answered . south frederick street . 
 UNK-0 
 come mr bloom said . 
 UNK-0 
 he touched the thin UNK-213 gently then took the UNK-544 seeing hand to 
 guide it forward . 
 UNK-0 
 say something to him . better not do the UNK-133 . they UNK-707 
 what you tell them . pass a common remark . 
 UNK-0 
 the rain kept off . 
 UNK-0 
 no answer . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-708 on his coat . UNK-46 his food i suppose . UNK-560 all different 
 for him . have to be UNK-968 first . like a UNK-337 hand his hand . like 
 UNK-212 was . sensitive . UNK-709 me up i UNK-48 from my hand . wonder 
 if he has a name . van . keep his UNK-330 clear of the horses legs tired 
 UNK-361 get his UNK-183 . thats right . clear . behind a bull in front of a 
 horse . 
 UNK-0 
 thanks sir . 
 UNK-0 
 knows im a man . voice . 
 UNK-0 
 right now ? first turn to the left . 
 UNK-0 
 the blind UNK-743 UNK-408 the UNK-526 and went on his way drawing 
 his UNK-330 back feeling again . 
 UNK-0 
 mr bloom walked behind the UNK-535 feet a UNK-719 suit of UNK-726 
 UNK-216 . poor young fellow ! how on earth did he know that van was there ? 
 must have felt it . see things in their UNK-133 perhaps kind of sense 
 of volume . weight or size of it something UNK-716 than the dark . wonder 
 would he feel it if something was removed . feel a gap . UNK-81 idea of 
 dublin he must have UNK-451 his way round by the stones . could he walk 
 in a UNK-552 if he UNK-180 that UNK-330 ? UNK-934 UNK-290 face like a fellow 
 going in to be a priest . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-856 ! that was that UNK-644 name . 
 UNK-0 
 look at all the things they can learn to do . read with their fingers . 
 tune UNK-362 . or we are surprised they have any UNK-439 . why we think a 
 UNK-109 person or a UNK-59 UNK-324 if he says something we might say . 
 of course the other UNK-344 are more . UNK-224 . UNK-590 baskets . people 
 ought to help . UNK-743 i could buy for UNK-573 birthday . UNK-725 
 sewing . might take an UNK-745 . dark men they call them . 
 UNK-0 
 sense of smell must be stronger too . UNK-908 on all sides UNK-450 
 together . each street different smell . each person too . then the spring 
 the summer UNK-908 . UNK-560 ? they say you cant taste wines with your 
 eyes shut or a cold in the head . also smoke in the dark they say get no 
 pleasure . 
 UNK-0 
 and with a woman for instance . more UNK-211 not seeing . that girl 
 passing the stewart institution head in the air . look at me . i have 
 them all on . must be strange not to see her . kind of a form in his 
 minds eye . the voice temperatures when he UNK-534 her with his 
 fingers must almost see the lines the curves . his hands on her hair 
 for instance . say it was black for instance . good . we call it black . 
 then passing over her white skin . different feel perhaps . feeling of 
 white . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-787 . must answer . UNK-233 today . send her a postal order two 
 UNK-51 half a crown . accept my little present . UNK-174 just here 
 too . wait . think over it . 
 UNK-0 
 with a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair UNK-707 back above 
 his ears . again . UNK-484 of fine fine UNK-197 . then gently his finger felt 
 the skin of his right UNK-139 . UNK-168 hair there too . not smooth enough . 
 the belly is the UNK-824 . UNK-159 about . there he goes into frederick 
 street . perhaps to UNK-67 dancing academy piano . might be UNK-571 
 my UNK-442 . 
 UNK-0 
 walking by UNK-695 UNK-722 he UNK-712 his hand between his UNK-187 
 and UNK-48 and pulling aside his shirt gently felt a UNK-849 fold of 
 his belly . but i know its UNK-708 yellow . want to try in the dark to 
 see . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-740 his hand and pulled his dress to . 
 UNK-0 
 poor fellow ! quite a boy . terrible . really terrible . what dreams would 
 he have not seeing ? life a dream for him . where is the justice being 
 born that way ? all those women and children UNK-880 UNK-245 UNK-416 
 and UNK-69 in new york . holocaust . karma they call that UNK-233 
 for UNK-104 you did in a past life the UNK-469 met him pike UNK-167 . 
 dear dear dear . UNK-47 of course but somehow you cant cotton on to 
 them UNK-274 . 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 he came a step a UNK-531 forward on UNK-373 UNK-666 and a step 
 UNK-746 a UNK-531 on the UNK-384 floor .

 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 then he passed the female UNK-51 . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 for he was a medical 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 UNK-236 old UNK-550 . . . 
 UNK-0 
 i feel you would need one more for UNK-107 . seven is dear to the 
 UNK-185 mind . the UNK-160 seven w UNK-220 . calls them .

 UNK-0 
 our young irish UNK-737 john UNK-147 UNK-967 have yet to create a 
 figure which the world will set beside UNK-482 UNK-892 UNK-107 though 
 i UNK-859 him as old ben did on this side UNK-44 . 
 UNK-0 
 all these questions are UNK-7 academic russell UNK-215 out of his 
 shadow . i mean whether UNK-107 is shakespeare or james i or essex . 
 UNK-93 discussions of the UNK-769 of jesus . art has to reveal 
 to us ideas UNK-806 spiritual UNK-84 . the supreme question about a 
 work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring . the painting of 
 UNK-894 UNK-923 is the painting of ideas . the UNK-533 poetry of UNK-838 
 the words of UNK-107 bring our minds into contact with the eternal 
 wisdom UNK-308 world of ideas . all the rest is the UNK-886 of 
 UNK-633 for UNK-633 . 
 UNK-0 
 a . e . has been telling some UNK-551 UNK-961 . wall UNK-360 strike

 UNK-0 
 the UNK-711 were UNK-633 first stephen said UNK-60 . 
 UNK-613 was once UNK-308 UNK-413 . 
 UNK-0 
 and has remained so one should hope john UNK-147 UNK-990 said . one 
 can see him a model UNK-413 with his diploma under his arm . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-20 again at the now UNK-21 UNK-663 face . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-806 spiritual . father word and holy breath . UNK-948 the 
 UNK-198 man . UNK-918 UNK-613 UNK-298 of the beautiful the logos who 
 UNK-519 in us at every moment . this UNK-545 is that . i am the fire upon 
 the UNK-92 . i am the UNK-199 butter . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-462 judge the UNK-149 roman of them all a UNK-814 . UNK-92 the name 
 UNK-825 in heaven UNK-223 k UNK-356 . their master whose identity is no 
 secret to UNK-938 . brothers of the great white lodge always watching 
 to see if they can help . the christ with the UNK-109 moisture of 
 light born of an UNK-801 virgin UNK-959 UNK-833 UNK-931 to the 
 plane of UNK-801 . the life UNK-49 is not for ordinary person . o UNK-507 . 
 must work off bad karma first . mrs cooper UNK-950 once UNK-30 our very 
 UNK-692 sister h UNK-507 UNK-220 UNK-464 UNK-313 . 
 UNK-0 
 o UNK-200 ! out UNK-934 ! UNK-842 ! you UNK-99 to look UNK-97 so you 
 UNK-99 when a UNK-532 UNK-136 of her UNK-313 . 
 UNK-0 
 mr best entered tall young mild light . he UNK-135 in his hand with 
 grace a notebook new large clean bright . 
 UNK-0 
 that model UNK-413 stephen said would find UNK-164 UNK-14 about 
 the UNK-979 of his UNK-743 soul the UNK-479 UNK-954 and 
 UNK-648 UNK-489 as UNK-502 as UNK-308 . 
 UNK-0 
 john UNK-147 UNK-449 said UNK-864 UNK-626 
 UNK-0 
 upon my word it makes my blood UNK-662 to hear anyone compare UNK-613 
 with UNK-106 . 
 UNK-0 
 which of the two stephen asked would have UNK-40 me from his 
 commonwealth ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-880 your UNK-210 definitions . UNK-276 is the UNK-92 of 
 UNK-201 . streams of UNK-271 and UNK-470 they worship . god noise in the 
 street very UNK-54 . space what you damn well have to see . through 
 spaces smaller than red UNK-948 of UNK-54 blood they UNK-404 after 
 UNK-687 UNK-724 into UNK-162 of which this vegetable world is but a 
 shadow . hold to the now the here through which all future UNK-819 to 
 the past . 
 UNK-0 
 mr best came forward UNK-677 towards his colleague . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-38 is gone he said . 
 UNK-0 
 is he ? 
 UNK-0 
 i was showing him UNK-576 book . UNK-2 quite UNK-696 dont 
 you know about UNK-847 UNK-4 of UNK-97 . i UNK-18 bring him in 
 to hear the discussion . UNK-2 gone to UNK-322 to buy it . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 bound thee forth my UNK-506 quick 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 to UNK-366 the UNK-577 public . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 UNK-799 i UNK-835 UNK-590 not my wish 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 in lean UNK-471 english . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-676 is going to his head john UNK-147 UNK-861 . 
 UNK-0 
 we feel in england . UNK-197 UNK-547 . gone . i UNK-146 his UNK-86 . green 
 UNK-564 stone . an emerald set in the ring of the sea . 
 UNK-0 
 people do not know how dangerous UNK-4 can be the UNK-438 egg of 
 russell warned UNK-77 . the movements which work UNK-158 in the 
 world are born out of the dreams and UNK-738 in a UNK-926 heart on the 
 UNK-644 . for them the earth is not an UNK-814 ground but the 
 living mother . the UNK-644 air of the academy and the arena produce the 
 UNK-137 novel the UNK-337 song . france produces the finest flower 
 of corruption in UNK-946 but the desirable life is revealed only to the 
 poor of heart the life of UNK-311 UNK-189 . 
 UNK-0 
 from these words mr best turned an UNK-82 face to stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-946 dont you know he said has written those wonderful UNK-312 
 poems stephen UNK-994 used to read to me in paris . the one about 
 UNK-107 . he says il se UNK-73 UNK-976 au UNK-690 de UNK-132 dont 
 you know reading the book of himself . he describes UNK-107 given in 
 a french town dont you know a provincial town . they UNK-617 it . 
 UNK-0 
 his free hand UNK-862 wrote tiny signs in air . 
 UNK-0

 concentration camp UNK-903 by mr UNK-341 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 i his UNK-483 UNK-656 following UNK-602 from UNK-450 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-239 and UNK-377 of UNK-343 UNK-244 whom none but we had UNK-344 . . . 
 UNK-0 
 between the UNK-482 smile and UNK-551 UNK-660 . the devil and the deep sea . 
 UNK-0 
 he will have it that UNK-107 is a UNK-446 john UNK-147 said 
 for mr UNK-199 UNK-950 . like the fat boy in UNK-600 he wants to make our

 UNK-0 
 what is a ghost ? stephen said with UNK-567 energy . one who has UNK-238 
 into UNK-916 through death through absence through change of 
 UNK-347 . UNK-170 london lay as far from UNK-822 as UNK-612 paris 
 lies from virgin dublin . who is the ghost from UNK-487 UNK-288 returning 
 to the world that has forgotten him ? who is king UNK-107 ? 
 UNK-0 
 john UNK-147 UNK-12 his spare body UNK-200 back to judge . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-64 . 
 UNK-0 
 it is this hour of a day in mid june stephen said UNK-301 with 
 a swift glance their hearing . the flag is up on the UNK-26 by the 
 UNK-849 . the bear UNK-224 UNK-978 in the pit near it paris garden . 
 UNK-809 who UNK-497 with UNK-510 UNK-784 their UNK-254 among the 
 UNK-704 . 
 UNK-0 
 local colour . work in all you know . make them UNK-323 . 
 UNK-0 
 shakespeare has left the UNK-823 house in silver street and walks 
 by the UNK-476 along the UNK-737 . but he does not stay to feed the 
 pen UNK-302 her game of UNK-933 towards the UNK-847 . the UNK-599 of avon 
 has other thoughts . 
 UNK-0 
 composition of place . UNK-77 UNK-337 make UNK-803 to help me ! 
 UNK-0 
 the play begins . a player comes on under the shadow made up in the 
 UNK-213 mail of a court buck a UNK-599 man with a bass voice . it is the 
 ghost the king a king and no king and the player is shakespeare who 
 has studied UNK-107 all the years of his life which were not UNK-385 in 
 order to play the part of the UNK-742 . he speaks the words to UNK-317 
 the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of UNK-402 
 calling him by a name 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-107 i am thy fathers spirit 
 UNK-0 
 bidding him list . to a son he speaks the son of his soul the prince 
 young UNK-107 and to the son of his body UNK-481 shakespeare who has 
 died in UNK-822 that his UNK-103 may live for ever . 
 UNK-0 
 is it possible that that player shakespeare a ghost by absence and in 
 the UNK-585 of buried denmark a ghost by death speaking his own words 
 to his own sons name had UNK-481 shakespeare lived he would have been 
 prince UNK-164 twin is it possible i want to know or UNK-757 that 
 he did not draw or UNK-189 the logical conclusion of those premises you 
 are the UNK-593 son i am the UNK-353 father your mother is the 
 guilty queen ann shakespeare born UNK-631 ? 
 UNK-0 
 but this UNK-405 into the family life of a great man russell began 
 UNK-782 . 
 UNK-0 
 art thou there UNK-961 ? 
 UNK-0 
 interesting only to the parish clerk . i mean we have the plays . i 
 mean when we read the poetry of king UNK-2 what is it to us how the 
 poet lived ? as for living our UNK-478 can do that for us UNK-652 de 
 UNK-468 has said . UNK-991 and UNK-405 into UNK-343 gossip of the day 
 the UNK-485 drinking the UNK-485 UNK-864 . we have king UNK-2 and it is

 do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries ? 
 john UNK-633 UNK-927 voice asked . her ghost at least has been laid 
 for ever . she died for literature at least before she was born . 
 UNK-0 
 she died stephen UNK-210 UNK-200 years after she was born . she 
 saw him into and out of the world . she took his first UNK-950 . she UNK-135 
 his children and she laid UNK-16 on his eyes to keep his UNK-863 closed 
 when he lay on his UNK-78 . 
 UNK-0 
 mothers UNK-78 . candle . the UNK-263 mirror . who brought me into 
 this world lies there UNK-215 under few cheap flowers . UNK-231 
 UNK-727 . 
 UNK-0 
 i UNK-457 alone . 
 UNK-0 
 john UNK-147 looked in the UNK-480 UNK-662 of his lamp . 
 UNK-0 
 the world believes that shakespeare made a mistake he said and got 
 out of it as quickly and as best he could . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-86 ! stephen said UNK-394 . a man of genius makes no mistakes . his 
 errors are UNK-588 and are the UNK-592 of discovery . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-592 of discovery opened to let in the UNK-822 librarian 
 UNK-369 bald UNK-185 and UNK-493 . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-807 john UNK-147 said UNK-569 is not a useful portal of 
 discovery one should imagine . what useful discovery did UNK-750 learn 
 from UNK-189 ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-85 stephen answered and from his mother how to bring thoughts 
 into the world . what he UNK-294 from his other wife UNK-8 UNK-920 
 UNK-797 ! UNK-963 UNK-120 no man not a woman will ever 
 know . but neither the UNK-43 UNK-547 nor the UNK-460 saved him 
 from the UNK-375 of UNK-48 UNK-557 and their UNK-560 of UNK-905 . 
 UNK-0 
 but ann UNK-631 ? mr UNK-199 quiet voice said UNK-603 . yes we seem 
 to be UNK-779 her as shakespeare himself forgot her . 
 UNK-0 
 his look went from UNK-995 UNK-153 to UNK-575 UNK-241 to remind to 
 UNK-550 them not UNK-286 then to the UNK-903 UNK-747 UNK-586 UNK-609 
 though UNK-357 . 
 UNK-0 
 he had a good UNK-457 of wit stephen said and no UNK-72 memory . 
 he carried a memory in his wallet as he UNK-257 to UNK-994 UNK-604 
 the girl i left behind me . if the earthquake did not time it we should 
 know where to place poor UNK-498 sitting in his form the cry of UNK-390 
 the UNK-635 UNK-622 and her blue windows . that memory UNK-447 and 
 UNK-809 lay in the UNK-945 of every UNK-716 in london . 
 is UNK-399 the UNK-807 UNK-407 ? UNK-941 calls her young and 
 beautiful . do you think the writer of UNK-877 and UNK-466 a 
 UNK-954 UNK-880 had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose 
 the UNK-111 UNK-795 in all UNK-662 to lie UNK-687 ? good he left her 
 and gained the world of men . but his UNK-17 are the women of a boy . 
 their life thought speech are UNK-256 them by males . he chose badly ? he 
 was chosen it seems to me . if others have their will ann UNK-718 a way . 
 by cock she was to blame . she put the UNK-535 on him sweet and 
 UNK-482 . the UNK-482 UNK-730 who UNK-471 over the boy UNK-809 UNK-208 
 to UNK-900 as UNK-80 to the UNK-446 act is a UNK-228 UNK-822 
 UNK-704 who UNK-315 in a UNK-743 a lover younger than herself .

 UNK-0 
 where there is a UNK-613 stephen said there must have been 
 first a UNK-457 . 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 UNK-193 in leather UNK-23 UNK-8 a UNK-15 in UNK-399 UNK-136

 he won to him tender people a whore of UNK-587 ladies of UNK-99 
 UNK-367 UNK-103 wives . fox and UNK-793 . and in new place a UNK-849 
 UNK-47 body that once was UNK-503 once as sweet as fresh as 
 UNK-0 now her leaves falling all bare UNK-674 of the narrow 
 grave and UNK-335 . 
 UNK-0 
 yes . so you think . . . 
 UNK-0 
 the door closed behind the UNK-192 . 
 UNK-0 
 rest suddenly UNK-845 the UNK-317 UNK-525 cell rest of warm and 
 UNK-524 air . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-739 lamp . 
 UNK-0 
 here he UNK-432 things that were not what UNK-856 would have lived to do 
 had he believed the UNK-174 what might have been possibilities of 
 the possible as possible things not known what name UNK-617 UNK-135 when 
 he lived among women . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-564 thoughts around me in UNK-431 UNK-121 in spice of words . 
 UNK-788 god of libraries a UNK-515 UNK-614 . and i heard the 
 voice of that egyptian UNK-259 . in painted chambers loaded with 
 UNK-528 . 
 UNK-0 
 they are still . once quick in the UNK-439 of men . still but an UNK-942 of 
 death is in them to tell me in my ear a UNK-124 tale urge me to UNK-395 
 their will . 
 UNK-0 
 certainly john UNK-147 UNK-486 of all great men he is the most 
 UNK-483 . we know nothing but that he lived and suffered . not even so 
 much . others UNK-767 our question . a shadow UNK-190 over all the rest . 
 UNK-0 
 but UNK-107 is so personal UNK-50 it ? mr best UNK-162 . i mean a kind 
 of private paper dont you know of his private life . i mean i dont 
 care a button dont you know who is killed or who is guilty . . . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-346 an innocent book on the edge of the desk UNK-21 his 
 UNK-529 . his private papers in the original . ta an bad ar an UNK-824 . UNK-743 
 in mo UNK-353 . put UNK-138 on it UNK-642 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-505 UNK-642 UNK-147 
 UNK-0 
 i was prepared for UNK-567 from what UNK-226 UNK-4 told us but 
 i may as well UNK-276 you that if you want to shake my belief that 
 shakespeare is UNK-107 you have a UNK-977 task before you . 
 UNK-0 
 bear with me . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-189 the UNK-160 of UNK-382 eyes UNK-976 UNK-977 under

 UNK-704 i thank thee for the word . 
 UNK-0 
 as we or mother dana UNK-759 and UNK-895 our bodies stephen said 
 from day to day their molecules UNK-104 to and UNK-161 so does the artist 
 UNK-759 and UNK-895 his image . and as the UNK-360 on my right breast is where 
 it was when i was born though all my body has been UNK-240 of new stuff 
 time after time so through the ghost of the UNK-823 father the image 
 of the UNK-872 son looks forth . in the intense instant of imagination 
 when the mind UNK-838 says is a UNK-546 coal that which i was is that 
 which i am and that which in possibility i may come to be . so in the 
 future the sister of the past i may see myself as i sit here now but 
 by reflection from that which then i shall be . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-978 of UNK-770 helped you at that UNK-770 . 
 UNK-0 
 yes mr best said UNK-680 . i feel UNK-107 quite young . the UNK-321 
 might be from the father but the UNK-409 with UNK-65 are surely from 
 the son . 
 UNK-0 
 has the wrong UNK-840 by the UNK-371 . he is in my father . i am in his son . 
 UNK-0 
 that UNK-360 is the last to go stephen said laughing . 
 UNK-0 
 john UNK-147 made a nothing UNK-238 UNK-732 . 
 UNK-0 
 if that were the UNK-185 of genius he said genius would be a 
 drug in the market . the plays of UNK-892 later years which UNK-449 
 UNK-336 so much UNK-820 another spirit . 
 UNK-0 
 the spirit of UNK-613 the UNK-822 librarian UNK-98 .

 UNK-457 . 
 UNK-0 
 said that .

 if you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over 
 the hell of time of king UNK-2 UNK-576 UNK-107 UNK-521 and UNK-258 
 look to see when and how the shadow UNK-400 . what UNK-718 the heart of a

 his own image to a man with that UNK-81 thing genius is the standard of 
 all experience material and moral . such an appeal will touch him . the 
 images of other males of his blood will UNK-495 him . he will see in them 
 UNK-16 attempts of nature to UNK-498 or to repeat himself . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-84 UNK-133 of the UNK-822 librarian UNK-419 UNK-671 with hope . 
 UNK-0 
 i hope mr UNK-1 will work out his theory for the UNK-979 of 
 the public . and we ought to mention another irish UNK-570 mr george 
 bernard shaw . nor should we forget mr frank harris . his articles on 
 shakespeare in the saturday review were surely brilliant . UNK-711 
 enough he too draws for us an UNK-188 relation with the dark lady of the 
 UNK-689 . the UNK-992 UNK-907 is william UNK-304 earl of UNK-81 . i own 
 that if the poet must be rejected such a UNK-719 would seem more in 
 harmony UNK-43 shall i say UNK-67 UNK-697 of what ought not to have 
 been . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-88 he UNK-167 and held a UNK-965 head among them UNK-413 egg prize 
 of their UNK-466 . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-670 and UNK-589 her with grave UNK-202 . UNK-709 love UNK-261 ? UNK-709 
 love thy man ? 
 UNK-0 
 that may be too stephen said . UNK-6 a saying of UNK-77 which mr 
 UNK-107 likes to quote . UNK-974 of what you wish for in youth because 
 you will get it in middle life . why does he send to one who is 
 a UNK-739 a bay where all men ride a UNK-685 of UNK-88 with a 
 UNK-399 UNK-865 a UNK-182 to UNK-182 for him ? he was himself a lord 
 of language and had made himself a UNK-447 gentleman and he had written 
 UNK-148 and UNK-262 . why ? belief in himself has been UNK-328 killed . he 
 was UNK-918 in a UNK-743 first UNK-603 i should say and he will 
 never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play UNK-739 the game 
 of laugh and lie down . assumed UNK-463 will not save him . no later 
 UNK-519 will undo the first UNK-519 . the UNK-996 of the UNK-579 has UNK-110 
 him there where love lies UNK-149 . if the UNK-807 is UNK-559 yet there 
 remains to her UNK-95 invisible weapon . there is i feel in the words 
 some UNK-626 of the flesh driving him into a new passion a UNK-13 shadow 
 of the first UNK-3 even his own understanding of himself . a like 
 fate UNK-754 him and the two UNK-33 UNK-676 in a UNK-839 . 
 UNK-0 
 they list . and in the UNK-642 of their ears i pour . 
 UNK-0 
 the soul has been before UNK-932 UNK-158 a poison UNK-207 in the 
 UNK-372 of a sleeping ear . but those who are done to death in sleep UNK-216 
 know the manner of their UNK-559 unless their creator UNK-367 their souls 
 with that knowledge in the life to come . the UNK-802 and the beast 
 with two UNK-116 that UNK-318 it king UNK-164 ghost could not know of were 
 he not UNK-771 with knowledge by his creator . that is why the speech 
 his lean UNK-471 english is always turned elsewhere UNK-746 . 
 UNK-352 and UNK-351 what he would but would not go with him from 
 UNK-821 UNK-140 ivory UNK-636 to UNK-982 breast bare with its 
 UNK-360 UNK-295 . he goes back UNK-129 of the creation he has UNK-664 up 
 to hide him from himself an old dog licking an old UNK-713 . but because 
 loss is his gain he passes on towards UNK-162 in UNK-822 
 personality UNK-599 by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he 
 has revealed . his beaver is up . he is a ghost a shadow now the wind by 
 UNK-88 rocks or what you will the seas voice a voice heard 
 only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow the son 
 UNK-948 with the father . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-294 ! was responded from the UNK-102 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-745 thou found me o mine enemy ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-486 . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-443 face UNK-332 as a UNK-46 buck UNK-4 came forward then 
 UNK-327 in UNK-536 towards the greeting of their UNK-479 . my UNK-82 . 
 UNK-0 
 you were speaking of the UNK-53 UNK-554 if i mistake not ? he 
 asked of stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-455 he UNK-593 UNK-219 with his UNK-778 panama as with a UNK-915 . 
 UNK-0 
 they make him welcome . was du UNK-360 UNK-156 du UNK-985 UNK-773 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-771 of UNK-513 UNK-170 UNK-381 UNK-300 most . 
 UNK-0 
 he who himself UNK-792 UNK-303 the holy ghost and himself sent himself 
 UNK-83 between himself and others who put upon by his UNK-516 
 UNK-627 and UNK-628 was UNK-389 like bat to UNK-320 UNK-674 on 
 UNK-608 who let him UNK-721 stood up UNK-290 hell UNK-560 into heaven 
 and there these UNK-510 hundred years UNK-379 on the right hand of his 
 own self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead 
 when all the quick shall be dead already . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-423 in UNK-845 UNK-732 . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-400 his hands . UNK-523 fall . o flowers ! UNK-215 with UNK-215 with UNK-215 
 UNK-250 . 
 UNK-0 
 yes indeed the UNK-822 librarian said . a most UNK-351 discussion . 
 mr UNK-4 ill be bound has his theory too of the play and of 
 shakespeare . all sides of life should be represented . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-24 on all sides equally . 
 UNK-0 
 buck UNK-4 thought UNK-555 
 UNK-0 
 shakespeare ? he said . i seem to know the name . 
 UNK-0 
 a flying sunny smile UNK-847 in his loose features . 
 UNK-0 
 to be sure he said UNK-617 UNK-307 . the UNK-26 that writes like 
 UNK-234 . 
 UNK-0 
 mr best turned to him . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-38 missed you he said . did you meet him ? hell see you after at 
 the d . b . c . UNK-2 gone to UNK-322 to buy UNK-847 UNK-4 of UNK-97 . 
 UNK-0 
 i came through the museum buck UNK-4 said . was he here ? 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-737 UNK-454 john UNK-147 answered are rather tired 
 perhaps of our UNK-559 of UNK-144 . i hear that an actress played 
 UNK-107 for the UNK-855 time last night in dublin . UNK-616 
 held that the prince was a woman . has UNK-159 made him out to be an 
 UNK-843 ? judge UNK-257 i believe is searching for some UNK-832 . he 
 UNK-380 his UNK-514 not his UNK-425 by saint patrick . 
 UNK-0 
 the most brilliant of all is that story of UNK-814 mr best said 
 UNK-272 his brilliant notebook . that portrait of mr w . h . where he 
 UNK-120 that the UNK-689 were written by a UNK-638 hughes a man all UNK-774 . 
 UNK-0 
 for UNK-638 hughes is it not ? the UNK-822 librarian asked . 
 UNK-0 
 or UNK-608 UNK-804 ? mr william himself . w . h . who am i ? 
 UNK-0 
 i mean for UNK-638 hughes mr best said UNK-105 his UNK-795 easily . of 
 course its all UNK-447 dont you know hughes and UNK-582 and UNK-774 
 the colour but its so typical the way he works it out . its the very 
 essence of UNK-769 dont you know . the light touch . 
 UNK-0 
 his glance touched their faces UNK-79 as he UNK-24 a blond UNK-10 . 
 UNK-560 essence of UNK-769 .

 the UNK-940 is never taken seriously when he is most serious . 
 UNK-0 
 they talked seriously of UNK-513 UNK-691 . 
 UNK-0 
 buck UNK-653 again heavy face eyed stephen UNK-401 . then his head

 UNK-596 UNK-846 of UNK-136 stephen said took the palm of beauty 
 from UNK-830 UNK-254 UNK-78 UNK-535 helen the wooden UNK-488 of troy

 back including a pair of fancy stays . the UNK-227 UNK-634 UNK-145 had 
 UNK-581 enough to UNK-550 with her of UNK-959 . twenty years he UNK-953 
 there between UNK-692 love and its UNK-861 UNK-630 and UNK-918 love 
 and its foul UNK-744 . you know UNK-568 story of the UNK-572 
 wife who UNK-432 dick UNK-317 to her bed after she had seen him in richard 
 iii and how shakespeare UNK-442 without more UNK-634 about nothing

 UNK-0 
 blessed margaret mary UNK-385 ! 
 UNK-0 
 and harry of six wives daughter . and other lady friends from 
 UNK-379 seats as lawn UNK-717 gentleman poet UNK-769 . but all those 
 twenty years what do you suppose poor UNK-650 in UNK-822 was doing 
 behind the diamond UNK-945 ? 
 UNK-0 
 do and do . thing done . in a UNK-79 of UNK-223 lane of UNK-48 UNK-68 
 he walks UNK-930 . an UNK-853 UNK-318 like her UNK-692 . UNK-505 of 
 UNK-867 eyes UNK-427 . he walks . one life is all . one body . do . but do . 
 UNK-450 in a UNK-155 of UNK-431 and UNK-499 hands are laid on UNK-809 . 
 UNK-0 
 buck UNK-4 UNK-470 john UNK-633 desk UNK-278 . 
 UNK-0 
 whom do you suspect ? he challenged . 
 UNK-0 
 say that he is the UNK-87 lover in the UNK-689 . once UNK-87 twice 
 UNK-87 . but the court UNK-57 UNK-87 him for a lord his UNK-43 . 
 UNK-0 
 love that dare not speak its name . 
 UNK-0 
 as an UNK-999 you mean john UNK-396 UNK-147 put in he loved a 
 lord . 
 UNK-0 
 old wall where sudden UNK-536 flash . at UNK-142 i watched them . 
 UNK-0 
 it seems so stephen said when he wants to do for him and for all 
 other and UNK-663 UNK-429 UNK-872 the holy office an UNK-858 does for the 
 UNK-118 . maybe like UNK-750 he had a UNK-317 to mother as he had a 
 UNK-807 to wife . but she the UNK-423 UNK-57 did not break a UNK-484 . two 
 UNK-898 are rank in that UNK-738 mind a broken UNK-380 and the UNK-567 
 UNK-9 on whom her favour has declined UNK-396 UNK-624 brother . sweet 
 ann i take it was hot in the blood . once a UNK-397 twice a UNK-397 . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen turned UNK-258 in his chair . 
 UNK-0 
 the burden of proof is with you not with me he said UNK-449 . if you 
 deny that in the fifth scene of UNK-107 he has UNK-23 her with UNK-487 
 tell me why there is no mention of her during the UNK-835 years 
 between the day she married him and the day she buried him . all those 
 women saw their men down and under mary her UNK-39 john ann her 
 poor dear UNK-658 when he went and died on her UNK-668 that he was the 
 first to go joan her four brothers UNK-220 her husband and all her 
 sons susan her husband too while UNK-713 daughter elizabeth to use 
 UNK-751 words wed her second having killed her first . 
 UNK-0 
 o yes mention there is . in the years when he was living UNK-861 in 
 royal london to pay a debt she had to UNK-589 forty UNK-51 from her 
 fathers shepherd . explain you then . explain the UNK-738 too UNK-700 he 
 has UNK-345 her to UNK-330 . 
 UNK-0 
 he faced their silence . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 to whom thus UNK-147 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 you mean the will . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 but that has been explained i believe by UNK-448 . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 she was entitled to her UNK-210 UNK-347 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 at common law . his legal knowledge was great 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 our judges tell us . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 him UNK-445 UNK-568 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 UNK-940 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 and therefore he left out her name 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 from the first draft but he did not leave out 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 the presents for his UNK-976 for his daughters 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 for his sister for his old UNK-894 in UNK-822 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 and in london . and therefore when he was UNK-318 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 as i believe to name her 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 he left her his 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 UNK-651 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 bed . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 UNK-909 .

 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-498 ! 
 UNK-0 
 pretty UNK-843 had few UNK-890 then john UNK-147 observed as 
 they have still if our UNK-720 plays are true to type . 
 UNK-0 
 he was a rich country gentleman stephen said with a coat of arms 
 and UNK-961 estate at UNK-822 and a house in ireland yard a UNK-130 
 UNK-642 a bill UNK-234 a UNK-879 . why did he not leave her 
 his best bed if he UNK-136 her to UNK-855 away the rest of her nights in 
 peace ? 
 UNK-0 
 it is clear that there were two beds a best and a UNK-651 mr 
 UNK-651 best said UNK-163 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-77 a UNK-868 et a UNK-143 UNK-254 buck UNK-4 and was 
 UNK-24 on . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-13 UNK-434 famous beds second UNK-147 UNK-405 UNK-165 . 
 let me think . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-13 UNK-434 that UNK-597 UNK-89 and bald UNK-588 sage 
 stephen said who when dying in UNK-386 UNK-756 and UNK-616 his UNK-439 pays 
 tribute to his UNK-505 UNK-804 to be laid in earth near the bones of his 
 dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress dont forget

 and the sense of property stephen said . he drew UNK-735 out of his 
 own long pocket . the son of a UNK-309 and UNK-956 he was himself 
 a UNK-415 and UNK-956 with ten UNK-661 of corn UNK-320 in the 
 UNK-912 UNK-987 . his UNK-965 are no doubt those UNK-8 of worship 
 mentioned by UNK-865 UNK-845 who reported his UNK-987 of dealing . 
 he UNK-262 a UNK-486 for the price of a few bags of UNK-119 and UNK-86 
 his pound of flesh in interest for every money UNK-256 . how else could 
 UNK-24 UNK-858 and UNK-783 get rich quick ? all events brought UNK-291 to 
 his mill . UNK-735 UNK-255 with the UNK-595 that followed the hanging

 his UNK-352 the UNK-916 sail UNK-372 on a tide of UNK-5 
 UNK-311 . UNK-662 UNK-517 are tried and we have a UNK-426 theory 
 of UNK-597 . the sea venture comes home from UNK-340 and the play 
 UNK-449 UNK-336 is written with UNK-554 UNK-304 our american UNK-664 . 
 the UNK-708 UNK-689 follow UNK-35 . as for UNK-741 elizabeth otherwise 
 UNK-812 UNK-141 the gross virgin who inspired the merry wives of 
 windsor let some UNK-85 from UNK-616 UNK-514 his life long for UNK-78 
 UNK-12 in the UNK-855 of the UNK-301 .

 saint thomas stephen UNK-21 said whose UNK-518 works i enjoy 
 reading in the original writing of incest from a UNK-836 different 
 from that of the new UNK-516 school mr UNK-107 spoke of UNK-332 it in his 
 wise and curious way to an UNK-585 of the emotions . he means that the 
 love so given to one near in blood is UNK-962 UNK-454 from some 
 stranger who it may be UNK-850 for it . jews whom christians tax with 
 UNK-585 are of all races the most given to UNK-83 . UNK-96 
 are made in anger . the christian laws which built up the UNK-537 of the 
 jews for whom as for the UNK-808 storm was shelter bound their 
 UNK-294 too with UNK-599 of steel . whether these be UNK-104 or UNK-51 old 
 UNK-498 will tell us at UNK-701 UNK-32 . but a man who holds so UNK-651 
 to what he calls his rights over what he calls his UNK-864 will hold 
 UNK-651 also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his 
 wife . no sir smile UNK-379 shall UNK-790 his UNK-921 or his wife or his 
 UNK-748 or his UNK-461 or his UNK-648 . 
 UNK-0 
 or his UNK-795 buck UNK-4 UNK-647 . 
 UNK-0 
 gentle will is being roughly handled gentle mr best said gently . 
 UNK-0 
 which will ? UNK-102 UNK-951 buck UNK-4 . we are getting mixed . 
 UNK-0 
 the will to live john UNK-147 UNK-80 for poor ann UNK-804 
 UNK-265 is the will to die . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-963 ! stephen UNK-124 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 what of all the will to do ? 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 it has UNK-134 long ago . . . 
 UNK-0 
 she lies laid out in UNK-475 UNK-729 in that UNK-651 bed the 
 UNK-710 queen even though you prove that a bed in those days was as 
 rare as a UNK-628 is now and that its UNK-428 were the wonder of seven 
 UNK-966 . in old age she takes up with UNK-880 one stayed with her 
 at new place and UNK-59 a UNK-876 of UNK-91 the town council paid for but in 
 which bed he UNK-613 it skills not to ask and heard she had a soul . she 
 read or had read to her his UNK-210 UNK-882 them to the merry 
 wives and UNK-876 her UNK-803 waters on the jordan she thought 
 over UNK-412 and eyes for UNK-348 UNK-468 and the most spiritual 
 UNK-530 to make the most UNK-636 souls UNK-207 . UNK-447 has twisted her 
 lips in prayer . UNK-681 of UNK-258 UNK-246 of UNK-212 . it is an age 
 of UNK-412 UNK-482 UNK-740 for its god . 
 UNK-0 
 history shows that to be true UNK-54 UNK-584 UNK-139 . the 
 ages succeed one another . but we have it on high authority that a UNK-54 
 worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family . i feel that 
 russell is right . what do we care for his wife or father ? i should say 
 that only family UNK-485 have family lives . UNK-845 was not a family man . 
 i feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation . 
 UNK-0 
 lean he lay back . UNK-523 deny thy UNK-427 the UNK-941 UNK-202 . UNK-523 UNK-578 
 with the UNK-623 he UNK-483 the cup . a UNK-751 in UNK-443 UNK-404 UNK-432 it 
 him . visits him here on quarter days . mr UNK-107 sir UNK-6 a gentleman 
 to see you . me ? says UNK-2 your father sir . give me my UNK-98 . enter 
 UNK-107 UNK-651 matthew a UNK-574 rough UNK-693 UNK-920 in UNK-200 with 
 a UNK-872 UNK-876 his UNK-114 stocks UNK-60 with UNK-655 of ten 
 forests a UNK-260 of UNK-263 in his hand . 
 UNK-0 
 your own ? he knows your old fellow . the UNK-283 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-968 to her UNK-707 UNK-839 from gay paris on the UNK-605 i 
 touched his hand . the voice new UNK-635 speaking . dr bob kenny is 
 attending her . the eyes that wish me well . but do not know me . 
 UNK-0 
 a father stephen said UNK-688 against UNK-626 is a necessary 
 evil . he wrote the play in the months that followed his fathers death . 
 if you hold that he a UNK-561 man with two UNK-746 daughters with 
 UNK-859 years of life UNK-158 UNK-616 del UNK-619 di UNK-250 UNK-123 with 
 fifty of experience is the UNK-355 undergraduate from UNK-37 then 
 you must hold that his UNK-342 old mother is the UNK-899 queen . no . 
 the UNK-341 of john shakespeare does not walk the night . from hour to 
 hour it UNK-611 and UNK-611 . he UNK-765 UNK-955 of UNK-210 having UNK-203 
 that UNK-738 estate upon his son . UNK-248 UNK-788 was the first 
 and last man who felt himself with child . UNK-210 in the sense of 
 conscious UNK-492 is unknown to man . it is a UNK-738 estate an 
 UNK-996 UNK-141 from only UNK-507 to only UNK-828 . on that 
 mystery and not on the madonna which the UNK-650 italian UNK-678 
 UNK-168 to the UNK-669 of europe the church is founded and founded UNK-690 
 because founded like the world macro and UNK-941 upon the void . 
 upon UNK-723 upon UNK-951 . UNK-931 UNK-898 subjective and 
 objective UNK-124 may be the only true thing in life . UNK-57 may be 
 a legal fiction . who is the father of any son that any son should love 
 him or he any son ? 
 UNK-0 
 what the hell are you driving at ? 
 UNK-0 
 i know . shut up . blast you . i have reasons . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-69 . UNK-705 . UNK-220 . UNK-527 . 
 UNK-0 
 are you UNK-475 to do this ? 
 UNK-0 
 they are UNK-729 by a UNK-919 shame so UNK-968 that the criminal 
 UNK-510 of the world UNK-567 with all other UNK-93 and UNK-168 
 hardly record its breach . sons with mothers UNK-43 with daughters 
 UNK-613 sisters loves that dare not speak their name UNK-595 with 
 UNK-915 UNK-758 with UNK-811 queens with prize UNK-988 . the son 
 UNK-543 mars beauty born he brings pain UNK-322 UNK-874 increases 
 care . he is a new male his growth is his fathers decline his youth 
 his fathers UNK-934 his friend his fathers enemy . 
 UNK-0 
 in UNK-10 UNK-35 i thought it . 
 UNK-0 
 what links them in nature ? an instant of blind UNK-351 . 
 UNK-0 
 am i a father ? if i were ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-409 UNK-481 hand . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-1 the african UNK-260 UNK-174 of all the UNK-850 of the 
 field held that the father was himself his own son . the UNK-230 of 
 UNK-844 with whom no word shall be impossible UNK-103 him . well if 
 the father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a 
 father be a son ? when UNK-923 or another poet 
 of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote UNK-107 he was not the 
 father of his own son merely but being no more a son he was and felt 
 himself the father of all his race the father of his own UNK-423 
 the father of his UNK-543 UNK-419 who by the same token never was 
 born for nature as mr UNK-107 UNK-240 her UNK-270 UNK-210 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-714 quick with pleasure looked up UNK-595 . UNK-665 
 UNK-220 a merry UNK-583 through the twisted UNK-592 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-799 . rarely . but UNK-799 . 
 UNK-0 
 himself his own father UNK-592 told himself . wait . i am big with 
 child . i have an UNK-543 child in my brain . UNK-992 UNK-968 ! a play ! the 
 plays the thing ! let me UNK-446 ! 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-669 his UNK-426 with both UNK-739 hands . 
 UNK-0 
 as for his family stephen said his mothers name lives in the 
 forest of UNK-734 . her death brought from him the scene with UNK-486 in 
 UNK-469 . his UNK-819 death is the UNK-139 of young arthur in 
 king john . UNK-107 the black prince is UNK-481 shakespeare . who the 
 girls in the UNK-811 in UNK-702 in UNK-495 tale are we know . 
 who UNK-466 UNK-461 of egypt and UNK-688 and UNK-447 are we may 
 guess . but there is another member of his family who is recorded . 
 UNK-0 
 the plot UNK-424 john UNK-147 said .

 italy set his face in a dark corner of his canvas . he has revealed it in 
 the UNK-689 where there is will in UNK-655 . like john UNK-655 his name 
 is dear to him as dear as the coat and crest he UNK-838 for on a bend 
 UNK-876 a UNK-99 or UNK-575 UNK-433 UNK-905 UNK-462 
 than his glory of greatest UNK-445 in the country . whats in a name ? 
 that is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the name that 
 we are told is ours . a star a UNK-59 a UNK-576 rose at his birth . 
 it UNK-493 by day in the UNK-100 alone UNK-367 than UNK-447 in the 
 night and by night it UNK-493 over delta in UNK-619 the UNK-70 
 UNK-221 which is the signature of his initial among the stars . his 
 eyes watched it UNK-110 on the horizon UNK-567 of the bear as 
 he walked by the UNK-581 summer fields at midnight returning from 
 UNK-945 and from her arms .

 UNK-584 phenomenon ? 
 UNK-0 
 a star by night stephen said . a UNK-271 of the cloud by day . 
 UNK-0 
 what UNK-470 to speak ? 
 UNK-0 
 stephen looked on his hat his stick his boots . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-427 my crown . my sword . his boots are UNK-464 the shape of my 
 feet . buy a pair . holes in my socks . UNK-185 too . 
 UNK-0 
 you make good use of the name john UNK-147 allowed . your own name is 
 strange enough . i suppose it explains your UNK-671 UNK-179 .

 UNK-0 
 mr best UNK-316 UNK-64 his book to say 
 UNK-0 
 thats very interesting because that brother UNK-701 dont you know 
 we find also in the old irish UNK-715 . just what you say . the three 
 brothers shakespeare . in UNK-572 too dont you know the UNK-986 . the 
 third brother that always UNK-8 the sleeping beauty and wins the best 
 prize . 
 UNK-0 
 best of best brothers . good better best . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-822 librarian UNK-73 near . 
 UNK-0 
 i should like to know he said which brother you . . . i understand you 
 to suggest there was UNK-464 with one of the brothers . . . but perhaps 
 i am UNK-525 ? 
 UNK-0 
 he caught himself in the act looked at all UNK-694 . 
 UNK-0 
 an UNK-505 from the UNK-102 called 
 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-41 ! father UNK-730 wants . . . 
 UNK-0 
 o father UNK-730 ! directly . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-171 UNK-450 UNK-666 UNK-450 rectly he was UNK-450 gone . 
 UNK-0 
 john UNK-147 touched the UNK-333 . 
 UNK-0 
 come he said . let us hear what you have to say of richard and UNK-819 . 
 you kept them for the last UNK-3 you ? 
 UNK-0 
 in asking you to remember those two noble UNK-200 UNK-810 UNK-119 and 
 UNK-810 UNK-819 stephen answered i feel i am asking too much perhaps . a 
 brother is as easily forgotten as an UNK-148 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-95 . 
 UNK-0 
 where is your brother ? UNK-182 hall . my UNK-696 . him then 
 UNK-12 UNK-4 now these . speech speech . but act . act speech . they 
 UNK-896 to try you . act . be UNK-145 on . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-95 . 
 UNK-0 
 i am tired of my voice the voice of UNK-702 . my kingdom for a drink . 
 UNK-0 
 on . 
 UNK-0 
 you will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he 
 took the stuff of his plays . why did he take them rather than others ? 
 richard a UNK-443 UNK-765 UNK-968 makes love to a UNK-46 ann 
 whats in a name ? UNK-786 and wins her a UNK-443 merry UNK-265 . richard 
 the UNK-757 third brother came after william the UNK-381 . the 
 other four acts of that play hang UNK-606 from that first . of all his 
 kings richard is the only king UNK-563 by UNK-892 UNK-510 
 the angel of the world . why is the UNK-854 of king UNK-2 in which 
 UNK-819 figures UNK-64 out of UNK-35 UNK-4 and UNK-328 on to a 
 celtic legend older than history ? 
 UNK-0 
 that was UNK-804 way john UNK-147 UNK-767 . we should not now combine 
 a UNK-160 UNK-54 with an excerpt from a novel by george UNK-108 . que 
 UNK-901 ? moore would say . he puts UNK-33 on the UNK-976 and makes 
 UNK-266 quote UNK-613 . 
 UNK-0 
 why ? stephen answered himself . because the theme of the false or 
 the UNK-88 or the UNK-310 brother or all three in one is to 
 shakespeare what the poor are not always with him . the note of 
 UNK-363 banishment from the heart UNK-363 from home sounds 
 UNK-302 from the two UNK-32 of UNK-923 UNK-90 till UNK-344 
 breaks his staff UNK-497 it certain UNK-300 in the earth and UNK-384 his 
 book . it UNK-247 itself in the middle of his life reflects itself in 
 another UNK-34 itself UNK-921 UNK-11 UNK-721 UNK-105 . 
 it UNK-34 itself again when he is near the grave when his married 
 daughter susan chip of the old block is accused of UNK-251 . but it 
 was the original sin that UNK-554 his understanding UNK-929 his will 
 and left in him a strong UNK-991 to evil . the words are those of 
 my UNK-153 UNK-910 of UNK-224 . an original sin and like original sin 
 committed by another in whose sin he too has UNK-251 . it is between the 
 lines of his last written words it is UNK-628 on his UNK-105 under 
 which her four bones are not to be laid . age has not UNK-821 it . beauty 
 and peace have not done it away . it is in infinite variety everywhere in 
 the world he has created in much UNK-634 about nothing twice in as you 
 like it in the UNK-811 in UNK-107 in measure for UNK-70 
 in all the other plays which i have not read . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-20 to free his mind from his minds bondage . 
 UNK-0 
 judge UNK-147 UNK-746 up . 
 UNK-0 
 the truth is UNK-216 he UNK-559 . he is the ghost and the prince . he 
 is all in all . 
 UNK-0 
 he is stephen said . the boy of act one is the mature man of act five . 
 all in all . in UNK-929 in UNK-576 he is UNK-549 and UNK-492 . he acts 
 and is UNK-145 on . lover of an ideal or a UNK-328 like jose he 
 kills the real carmen . his UNK-392 UNK-678 is the UNK-522 UNK-65 
 UNK-726 willing that the UNK-805 in him shall suffer . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-631 ! UNK-631 ! UNK-206 UNK-4 UNK-573 UNK-38 . o word of fear ! 
 UNK-0 
 dark dome received UNK-948 .

 UNK-0 
 at UNK-203 bridge father UNK-29 UNK-426 into an UNK-375 bound UNK-80 for 
 he UNK-376 to UNK-792 on foot the UNK-218 way past mud island . 
 UNK-0 
 father UNK-29 sat in a corner of the UNK-780 a blue ticket UNK-852 with 
 care in the eye of one UNK-191 kid UNK-516 while four UNK-51 a UNK-547 
 and five UNK-16 UNK-359 from his other UNK-191 UNK-454 into his purse . 
 passing the UNK-390 church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually 
 made his visit when one had UNK-493 thrown away the ticket . the 
 UNK-522 of the UNK-824 of the car seemed to father UNK-29 excessive 
 for a journey so short and cheap . father UNK-29 liked UNK-217 UNK-878 . 
 UNK-0 
 it was a peaceful day . the gentleman with the glasses opposite father 
 UNK-29 had finished explaining and looked down . his wife father UNK-29 
 supposed . a tiny UNK-83 opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with 
 the glasses . she raised her small UNK-354 fist UNK-7 ever so gently 
 UNK-878 her small UNK-354 fist on her opening mouth and UNK-24 UNK-286 
 UNK-951 . 
 UNK-0 
 father UNK-29 perceived her perfume in the car . he perceived also that 
 the UNK-795 man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the 
 seat . 
 UNK-0 
 father UNK-29 at the UNK-254 placed the host with difficulty in the 
 mouth of the UNK-795 old man who had the UNK-204 head . 
 UNK-0 
 at UNK-55 bridge the UNK-80 UNK-46 and when it was about to go an old 
 woman rose suddenly from her place to UNK-189 . the UNK-654 pulled the 
 UNK-873 to stay the car for her . she passed out with her basket and 
 a UNK-150 and father UNK-29 saw the UNK-654 help her and net and 
 basket down and father UNK-29 thought that as she had nearly passed 
 the end of the penny fare she was one of those good souls who had 
 always to be told twice bless you my child that they have been 
 UNK-182 pray for me . but they had so many UNK-755 in life so many 
 UNK-89 poor creatures .

 from the UNK-235 mr eugene UNK-301 UNK-159 with thick UNK-579 at 
 father UNK-29 . 
 UNK-0 
 father UNK-29 thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and 
 of his UNK-566 on saint peter UNK-797 s UNK-467 . and the african mission and of 
 the UNK-618 of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and 
 yellow souls that had not received the UNK-786 of water when their last 
 hour came like a UNK-547 in the night . that book by the UNK-456 UNK-249 
 le UNK-178 des UNK-374 seemed to father UNK-29 a reasonable UNK-519 . those 
 were millions of human souls created by god in his own UNK-282 to 
 whom the faith had not d UNK-335 . been brought . but they were gods souls 
 created by god . it seemed to father UNK-29 a UNK-47 that they should all 
 be lost a waste if one might say . 
 UNK-0

 those were old UNK-591 days UNK-188 times in UNK-111 UNK-179 old times 
 in the UNK-180 . 
 UNK-0

 UNK-180 and of the book that might be written about UNK-249 houses and of 
 mary UNK-859 daughter of lord UNK-946 first UNK-569 of UNK-928 .

 UNK-251 fully UNK-399 UNK-759 inter UNK-208 UNK-364 UNK-745 with

 UNK-25 just take a UNK-455 . UNK-211 UNK-2 a UNK-381 member and no mistake .

 black border round it . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-30 all UNK-822 says he from the black country that would hang 
 their own fathers for five UNK-260 down and travelling expenses . 
 UNK-0 
 and he was telling us UNK-6 two UNK-13 waiting below to pull his 
 UNK-183 down when he gets the drop and UNK-224 him properly and then they 
 UNK-903 up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a UNK-241 . 
 UNK-0 
 in the dark land they UNK-44 the UNK-341 knights of the UNK-949 . their 
 deadly UNK-659 they UNK-111 yea and UNK-343 they lead to UNK-573 UNK-303 
 UNK-591 UNK-718 done a UNK-448 of blood for i will on UNK-214 suffer it even so 
 UNK-322 the lord . 
 UNK-0 
 so they started talking about capital punishment and of course bloom 
 comes out with the why and the UNK-977 and all the UNK-736 of the 
 business and the old dog UNK-749 him all the time im told those UNK-243 
 does have a sort of a UNK-81 UNK-143 coming off them for dogs about i dont 
 know what all UNK-253 effect and so forth and so on . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-6 one thing it UNK-696 a UNK-253 effect on says UNK-44 . 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0

 UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 gods truth says UNK-44 . i heard that from the head UNK-15 that was in 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-889 when they UNK-681 joe UNK-449 the UNK-838 . he told me when 
 they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like 
 a poker . 
 UNK-0 
 ruling passion strong in death says joe as someone said . 
 UNK-0 
 that can be explained by science says bloom . its only a natural 
 phenomenon dont you see because on account of the . . . 
 UNK-0 
 and then he starts with his UNK-24 about phenomenon and science and 
 this phenomenon and the other phenomenon . 
 UNK-0 
 the distinguished scientist UNK-546 professor UNK-743 UNK-88 UNK-216 
 medical evidence to the effect that the UNK-288 UNK-829 of the 
 UNK-784 UNK-732 and UNK-248 UNK-291 of the UNK-686 cord would 
 according to the best approved tradition of medical science be 
 calculated to UNK-948 produce in the human subject a violent 
 UNK-860 UNK-301 of the nerve centres of the UNK-862 apparatus 
 thereby causing the UNK-582 UNK-163 of the UNK-604 UNK-931 to rapidly 
 UNK-454 in such a way as to UNK-487 facilitate the flow of blood 
 to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ 
 resulting in the phenomenon which has been UNK-647 by the faculty 
 a UNK-234 UNK-356 and UNK-514 UNK-498 UNK-739 in UNK-849 
 UNK-508 per UNK-859 UNK-865 . 
 UNK-0 
 so of course the citizen was only waiting for the UNK-269 of the word and 
 he starts UNK-607 out of him about the UNK-53 and the old guard and 
 the men of UNK-200 and who fears to speak of UNK-106 and joe with 
 him about all the UNK-13 that were UNK-681 drawn and UNK-556 for 
 the cause by UNK-810 UNK-254 and a new ireland and new this that 
 and the other . talking about new ireland he ought to go and get a new 
 dog so he ought . UNK-247 UNK-315 UNK-64 UNK-798 and UNK-925 all round 
 the place and UNK-593 his UNK-476 . and round he goes to bob UNK-259 that 
 was standing UNK-44 a half one sucking up for what he could get . so of 
 course bob UNK-259 starts doing the bloody fool with him 
 UNK-0 
 give us the UNK-762 ! give the UNK-762 UNK-64 ! good old UNK-64 ! give the UNK-762

 UNK-311 off the bloody UNK-518 UNK-480 of the bloody old dog and he talking 
 all kinds of UNK-512 about training by UNK-663 and UNK-598 dog and 
 intelligent dog give you the bloody UNK-585 . then he starts UNK-958 a few 
 bits of old UNK-979 out of the bottom of a UNK-413 tin he told terry to 
 bring . UNK-211 he UNK-909 it down like old boots and his tongue hanging 
 out of him a yard long for more . near ate the tin and all hungry bloody 
 UNK-151 . 
 UNK-0 
 and the citizen and bloom having an argument about the point the 
 brothers UNK-828 and UNK-239 tone beyond on UNK-980 hill and robert UNK-730 
 and die for your country the tommy moore touch about sara UNK-149 and 
 UNK-23 far from the land . and bloom of course with his UNK-548 
 UNK-455 putting on UNK-538 with his UNK-572 face . phenomenon ! the fat UNK-930 he 
 married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a UNK-881 . 
 time they were stopping up in the city arms UNK-305 burke told me there 
 was an old one there with a UNK-871 UNK-384 of a UNK-401 and bloom 
 trying to get the soft side of her doing the UNK-227 playing UNK-798 
 to come in for a bit of the UNK-472 in her will and not eating meat of a 
 friday because the old one was always UNK-512 her UNK-449 and taking the 
 UNK-358 out for a walk . and one time he led him the rounds of dublin and 
 by the holy farmer he never UNK-5 crack till he brought him home as 
 drunk as a UNK-631 UNK-900 and he said he did it to teach him the UNK-473 of 
 alcohol and by UNK-705 if the three women UNK-3 near UNK-211 him its 
 a UNK-81 story the old one UNK-34 wife and mrs UNK-267 that kept the 
 hotel . jesus i had to laugh at UNK-305 burke taking them off UNK-574 
 the fat . and bloom with his but dont you see ? and but on the other 
 hand . and sure more be token the UNK-358 im told was in powers after 
 the UNK-604 round in cope street going home UNK-877 in a cab five 
 times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the 
 bloody establishment . phenomenon ! 
 UNK-0 
 the memory of the dead says the citizen taking up his UNK-704 and 
 UNK-474 at bloom . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-42 ay says joe . 
 UNK-0

 are by our side and the UNK-244 we hate before us . 
 UNK-0 
 the last UNK-399 was affecting in the extreme . from the UNK-494 far 
 and near the UNK-379 UNK-694 UNK-545 UNK-967 while all around the 
 UNK-484 UNK-964 rolled the UNK-465 warning of a hundred UNK-130 drums 
 UNK-572 by the hollow UNK-767 of pieces of UNK-634 . the UNK-719 
 UNK-416 of thunder and the UNK-375 UNK-410 of lightning which lit up 
 the UNK-274 scene UNK-243 that the UNK-135 of heaven had UNK-256 its 
 UNK-303 UNK-93 to the already UNK-744 UNK-876 . a UNK-891 rain 
 UNK-207 down from the UNK-344 of the angry UNK-100 upon the 
 UNK-336 heads of the assembled UNK-431 which UNK-143 at the 
 lowest computation five hundred thousand persons . a UNK-392 of dublin 
 metropolitan police UNK-718 by the chief commissioner in person 
 maintained order in the vast UNK-352 for whom the york street brass and 
 reed band UNK-750 away the UNK-661 time by UNK-122 rendering on

 UNK-471 who UNK-57 the night before larry was UNK-269 in their usual 
 UNK-756 fashion . our two UNK-664 UNK-795 did a UNK-710 trade 
 with their UNK-387 among lovers of the comedy element and nobody 
 who has a corner in his heart for real irish fun without UNK-194 
 will UNK-445 them their UNK-919 UNK-16 . the children of the male and 
 female UNK-553 hospital who UNK-614 the windows UNK-558 the scene 
 were UNK-649 with this unexpected addition to the days entertainment 
 and a word of praise is due to the little sisters of the poor for their 
 excellent idea of UNK-695 the poor UNK-133 and UNK-746 children 
 a UNK-975 UNK-351 treat . the UNK-838 UNK-749 which included 
 many UNK-798 ladies was UNK-159 by their UNK-225 to the most 
 UNK-638 positions on the UNK-246 while the UNK-377 foreign 
 delegation known as the friends of the emerald isle was UNK-112 
 on a tribune directly opposite . the delegation present in full force

 possible UNK-474 terms concerning the UNK-749 UNK-328 which 
 they had been called upon to witness . an animated UNK-205 in which 
 all took part UNK-397 among the f . o . t . e . i . as to whether the UNK-106 
 or the UNK-113 of march was the correct date of the birth of UNK-192 
 UNK-186 saint . in the course of the argument UNK-85 UNK-285

 restored order and with lightning UNK-240 proposed the UNK-401 
 of the month as a solution equally UNK-176 for both UNK-609 
 parties . the UNK-739 UNK-95 suggestion at once UNK-177 to all 
 and was UNK-809 accepted . UNK-233 UNK-356 was UNK-496 
 UNK-245 by all the f UNK-336 UNK-731 UNK-814 UNK-815 . several of whom were bleeding 
 UNK-421 . UNK-643 UNK-916 having been UNK-951 from 
 UNK-733 the presidential UNK-731 it was explained by his legal 
 UNK-317 UNK-445 UNK-293 that the various articles UNK-427 in his 
 UNK-727 pockets had been UNK-141 by him during the UNK-549 from the 
 pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their 
 UNK-344 . the objects which included several hundred ladies and 
 UNK-963 gold and silver watches were promptly restored to their 
 UNK-421 owners and general harmony UNK-137 supreme . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-40 UNK-378 UNK-305 UNK-426 on to the UNK-50 in UNK-375 
 morning dress and wearing his favourite flower the UNK-964 
 UNK-797 . he announced his presence by that gentle UNK-430 UNK-766 
 which so many have tried UNK-29 to UNK-642 
 UNK-696 yet UNK-687 so characteristic of the man . the arrival of the 
 UNK-262 UNK-938 was UNK-593 by a UNK-612 of UNK-434 from the 
 huge UNK-705 the UNK-838 ladies UNK-343 their UNK-165 in 
 their excitement while the even more UNK-510 foreign UNK-305 
 UNK-78 UNK-95 in a UNK-577 of UNK-155 UNK-395 UNK-316 UNK-788 UNK-337 
 UNK-579 UNK-847 UNK-600 UNK-487 UNK-324 allah UNK-22 which the UNK-924 
 UNK-19 of the UNK-858 of the land of song a high double f UNK-371 
 those UNK-266 lovely notes with which the UNK-378 UNK-77 UNK-752 
 our UNK-613 was easily UNK-983 . it was exactly 
 UNK-538 UNK-270 . the signal for prayer was then promptly given by 
 UNK-47 and in an instant all heads were UNK-336 the UNK-522 
 UNK-829 UNK-530 which has been in the possession of his family 
 since the revolution of UNK-232 being removed by his medical UNK-317 
 in attendance dr UNK-756 . the learned UNK-773 who administered the last 
 UNK-416 of holy religion to the hero UNK-484 when about to pay the death 
 penalty UNK-97 in a most christian spirit in a pool of UNK-517 his 
 UNK-987 above his UNK-698 head and offered up to the UNK-980 of grace 
 UNK-479 prayers of UNK-752 . hand by the block stood the UNK-771 figure 
 of the UNK-650 his UNK-778 being UNK-494 in a UNK-556 pot 
 with two circular UNK-357 UNK-383 through which his eyes UNK-303 
 UNK-869 . as he UNK-864 the fatal signal he tested the edge of his 
 horrible weapon by UNK-711 it upon his UNK-945 UNK-735 or UNK-913 
 in rapid UNK-141 a UNK-275 of sheep which had been provided by the 
 UNK-652 of his fell but necessary office . on a UNK-218 UNK-618 table 
 near him were UNK-969 arranged the UNK-716 knife the various 
 UNK-163 UNK-711 UNK-224 appliances specially supplied by the 
 UNK-468 firm of UNK-409 UNK-428 john round and sons sheffield 
 a UNK-330 UNK-450 UNK-353 for the reception of the UNK-937 colon 
 blind UNK-665 and appendix etc when successfully UNK-740 and two 
 UNK-317 UNK-508 UNK-81 to receive the most precious blood of the 
 most precious victim . the UNK-754 of the UNK-136 cats and 
 dogs home was in attendance to UNK-915 these vessels when UNK-348 
 to that UNK-711 institution . quite an excellent UNK-263 consisting of 
 UNK-212 and eggs UNK-49 UNK-698 and UNK-538 done to a UNK-757 delicious 
 hot breakfast rolls and UNK-771 tea had been UNK-69 provided 
 by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the 
 tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and UNK-521 
 the UNK-233 interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he 
 with an UNK-330 rare in these our times rose UNK-754 to the occasion 
 and expressed the dying wish immediately UNK-669 to that the meal 
 should be divided in UNK-760 parts among the members of the sick and 
 UNK-571 UNK-284 association as a token of his regard and UNK-139 . 
 the nec and non plus ultra of UNK-370 were reached when the UNK-521 
 bride elect burst her way through the UNK-818 ranks of the UNK-718 
 and UNK-168 herself upon the UNK-241 UNK-186 of him who was about to be 
 launched into UNK-162 for her sake . the hero UNK-177 her UNK-954 form in 
 a loving UNK-73 UNK-289 UNK-441 UNK-482 my own . encouraged by 
 this use of her christian name she UNK-166 UNK-311 all the various 
 suitable areas of his person which the UNK-149 of prison UNK-157 
 permitted her UNK-242 to reach . she UNK-331 to him as they UNK-907 the salt 
 streams of their tears that she would ever UNK-617 his memory that she 
 would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his 
 lips as if he were but going to a UNK-693 match in UNK-11 park . she 
 brought back to his UNK-141 the happy days of UNK-704 childhood 
 together on the banks of anna UNK-564 when they had UNK-16 in the 
 innocent UNK-459 of the young and UNK-412 of the UNK-348 present 
 they both UNK-20 UNK-496 all the UNK-9 including the UNK-380 
 pastor joining in the general UNK-95 . that monster audience simply 
 UNK-270 with delight . but UNK-11 they were overcome with UNK-383 and UNK-669 
 their hands for the last time . a fresh UNK-48 of tears burst from their 
 UNK-256 UNK-97 and the vast UNK-705 of people touched to the UNK-761 
 core broke into UNK-893 UNK-319 not the least affected being the 
 aged UNK-217 himself . big strong men officers of the peace and 
 UNK-449 giants of the royal irish UNK-397 were making frank use of 
 their UNK-165 and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye 
 in that record UNK-502 . a most romantic incident occurred when a 
 UNK-218 young oxford graduate noted for his UNK-265 towards the fair 
 sex UNK-426 forward and presenting his visiting card UNK-418 
 and UNK-517 tree UNK-621 the hand of the UNK-722 young lady 
 requesting her to name the day and was accepted on the spot . every lady 
 in the audience was presented with a UNK-210 UNK-129 of the occasion 
 in the shape of a UNK-241 and UNK-665 UNK-813 a timely and generous 
 act which UNK-685 a fresh UNK-256 of UNK-370 and when the UNK-995 young 
 UNK-886 the UNK-623 by the way of one of the most UNK-132 names 
 in UNK-478 history placed on the finger of his UNK-521 UNK-572 an 
 expensive engagement ring with UNK-226 set in the form of a 
 UNK-760 UNK-292 the excitement knew no UNK-784 . UNK-376 even the 
 UNK-529 UNK-880 UNK-768 UNK-28 UNK-20 
 UNK-601 who UNK-448 on the sad occasion he who had UNK-944 a 
 considerable number of UNK-360 from the UNK-87 without UNK-503 
 could not now UNK-561 his natural UNK-370 . with his mailed UNK-282 
 he UNK-30 away a UNK-238 tear and was UNK-196 by those UNK-513 
 UNK-572 who happened to be in his immediate UNK-737 to UNK-208 to 
 himself in a UNK-83 UNK-286 
 UNK-0 
 god UNK-602 if she UNK-91 a UNK-335 that there bleeding UNK-114 . UNK-602 it 
 makes me kind of bleeding cry straight it does when i sees her cause 
 i thinks of my old UNK-762 whats waiting for me down UNK-306 way . 
 UNK-0 
 so then the citizen begins talking about the irish language and the 
 corporation meeting and all to that and the UNK-649 that cant speak 
 their own language and joe UNK-707 in because he stuck someone for a 
 UNK-260 and bloom putting in his old UNK-98 with his UNK-118 UNK-645 that 
 he UNK-895 off of joe and talking about the UNK-886 league and the 
 UNK-462 league and drink the UNK-217 of ireland . UNK-462 is 
 about the size of it . UNK-211 UNK-25 let you pour all manner of drink down 
 his throat till the lord would call him before UNK-306 ever see the UNK-75 
 of his UNK-395 . and one night i went in with a fellow into one of their 
 musical UNK-648 song and dance about she could get up on a UNK-947 of 
 hay she could my UNK-21 lay and there was a fellow with a UNK-734 
 blue ribbon badge UNK-311 out of him in irish and a lot of UNK-908 
 UNK-293 going about with UNK-267 beverages and selling UNK-408 
 and UNK-725 and UNK-543 and a few old dry UNK-236 UNK-211 UNK-120 
 entertainment dont be talking . ireland UNK-357 is ireland free . and 
 then an old fellow starts blowing into his UNK-739 and all the UNK-925 
 UNK-910 their feet to the tune the old cow died of . and one or two 
 sky UNK-567 having an eye around that there was no UNK-263 on with the 
 females hitting below the belt . 
 UNK-0 
 so UNK-150 as i was saying the old dog seeing the tin was empty 
 starts UNK-815 around by joe and me . id train him by UNK-663 so i 
 would if he was my dog . give him a UNK-885 fine kick now and again 
 where it UNK-9 blind him . 
 UNK-0 
 afraid hell bite you ? says the citizen UNK-372 . 
 UNK-0 
 no says i . but he might take my leg for a UNK-670 . 
 UNK-0 
 so he calls the old dog over . 
 UNK-0 
 whats on you UNK-286 ? says he . 
 UNK-0 
 then he starts UNK-721 and UNK-540 and talking to him in irish and the 
 old UNK-743 UNK-519 letting on to answer like a UNK-77 in the opera . 
 such UNK-519 you never heard as they let off between them . someone that 
 has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro UNK-262 UNK-504 to 
 the papers about the UNK-901 order for a dog the like of that . UNK-519 
 and UNK-962 and his eye all UNK-714 from the UNK-520 is in it and the 
 UNK-122 UNK-794 out of his UNK-968 . 
 UNK-0 
 all those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the 
 lower animals and their name is UNK-251 should make a point of not 
 missing the really UNK-902 exhibition of UNK-956 given by the 
 famous old irish red UNK-329 UNK-524 formerly known by the UNK-344 of 
 UNK-745 and recently UNK-782 by his large circle of friends and 
 UNK-670 owen UNK-286 . the exhibition which is the result of years 
 of training by UNK-663 and a carefully UNK-965 dietary system 
 UNK-934 among other achievements the UNK-826 of verse . our 
 greatest living UNK-462 expert wild horses shall not drag it from us ! 
 has left no stone UNK-804 in his efforts to UNK-136 and compare 
 the verse UNK-473 and has found it bears a striking UNK-973 the 
 UNK-184 are ours to the UNK-855 of ancient celtic UNK-737 . we are not 
 speaking so much of those UNK-80 UNK-4 with which the writer who 
 UNK-838 his identity under the UNK-231 UNK-37 of the little 
 sweet branch has UNK-90 the UNK-372 world but rather as 
 a contributor d . o . c . points out in an interesting communication 
 published by an evening contemporary of the UNK-460 and more personal 
 note which is found in the UNK-651 UNK-75 of the famous UNK-700 and 
 of UNK-958 UNK-35 to say nothing of a more modern UNK-210 at present 
 very much in the public eye . we UNK-119 a UNK-540 which has been 
 rendered into english by an UNK-926 scholar whose name for the moment we 
 are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will 
 find the UNK-637 UNK-858 rather more than an indication . the UNK-83 
 system of the UNK-628 original which UNK-608 the UNK-49 UNK-664 
 and UNK-784 rules of the welsh UNK-679 is UNK-145 more 
 complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has 
 been well caught . perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly 
 increased if UNK-205 verse be spoken somewhat slowly and UNK-264 in 
 a tone UNK-824 of UNK-679 UNK-87 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 the UNK-217 of my UNK-147 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 seven days every day 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 and seven dry UNK-809 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 on you UNK-778 UNK-539 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 has no UNK-137 of water 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 to cool my courage 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 and my UNK-655 red UNK-710 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 after UNK-554 lights . 
 UNK-0 
 so he told terry to bring some water for the dog and UNK-211 you could 
 hear him UNK-252 it up a mile off . and joe asked him would he have 
 another . 
 UNK-0 
 i will says he a UNK-410 to show UNK-6 no ill feeling . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-211 UNK-2 not as green as UNK-2 UNK-861 . UNK-302 around from one 
 pub to another leaving it to your own UNK-88 with old UNK-846 dog 
 and getting fed up by the UNK-545 and UNK-195 . entertainment for 
 man and beast . and says joe 
 UNK-0 
 could you make a hole in another UNK-395 ? 
 UNK-0 
 could a swim duck ? says i . 
 UNK-0 
 same again terry says joe . are you sure you UNK-19 have anything in 
 the way of liquid UNK-732 ? says he . 
 UNK-0 
 thank you no says bloom . as a matter of fact i just wanted to meet 
 martin UNK-11 dont you see about this insurance of poor UNK-707 . 
 martin asked me to go to the house . you see he UNK-28 i mean UNK-3 
 serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and 
 UNK-414 under the act the UNK-747 cant recover on the policy . 
 UNK-0 
 holy wars says joe laughing thats a good one if old UNK-735 is 
 UNK-961 . so the wife comes out top dog what ? 
 UNK-0 
 well thats a point says bloom for the UNK-522 UNK-652 . 
 UNK-0 
 whose UNK-652 ? says joe . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-522 UNK-145 i mean says bloom . 
 UNK-0 
 then he starts all confused UNK-105 it up about UNK-363 under the act 
 like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit 
 of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that 
 UNK-28 UNK-998 UNK-909 the money and if now the wife or the UNK-265 
 UNK-524 the UNK-76 right till he near had the head of me UNK-775 
 with his UNK-363 under the act . he was bloody safe he UNK-69 run in 
 himself under the act that time as a UNK-429 and UNK-97 only he had a 
 friend in court . selling UNK-315 tickets or what do you call it royal 
 hungarian UNK-513 lottery . true as UNK-14 there . o UNK-377 me to an 
 UNK-399 ! royal and UNK-513 hungarian UNK-769 . 
 UNK-0 
 so bob UNK-259 comes UNK-354 around asking bloom to tell mrs UNK-28 he 
 was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and 
 to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was 
 never a UNK-619 a UNK-894 than poor little UNK-766 thats dead to tell her . 
 UNK-553 with bloody UNK-1 . and UNK-144 UNK-34 hand doing the UNK-472 
 to tell her that . shake hands brother . UNK-14 a UNK-429 and im another . 
 UNK-0 
 let me said he so far UNK-824 upon our UNK-930 which however 
 slight it may appear if UNK-863 by the standard of mere time is founded 
 as i hope and believe on a UNK-155 of mutual UNK-139 as to request of 
 you this favour . but should i have UNK-631 the limits of reserve 
 let the UNK-904 of my feelings be the excuse for my UNK-971 . 
 UNK-0 
 no UNK-371 the other i appreciate to the full the UNK-535 which 
 UNK-837 your conduct and i shall discharge the office you UNK-801 to 
 me UNK-550 by the reflection that though the UNK-617 be one of UNK-234 
 this proof of your confidence UNK-352 in some measure the UNK-321 of 
 the cup . 
 UNK-0 
 then suffer me to take your hand said he . the UNK-403 of your heart 
 i feel sure will UNK-599 to you better than my UNK-939 words 
 the expressions which are most suitable to UNK-915 an UNK-370 whose 
 UNK-364 were i to give UNK-662 to my feelings would UNK-570 me even of 
 speech . 
 UNK-0 
 and off with him and out trying to walk straight . UNK-911 at five 
 UNK-270 . night he was near being UNK-294 only UNK-65 leonard knew the 
 bobby UNK-241 . blind to the world up in a UNK-892 in bride street after 
 closing time UNK-583 with two UNK-14 and a UNK-367 on guard drinking 
 porter out of UNK-825 . and calling himself a UNK-605 for the UNK-14 
 joseph UNK-163 and talking against the catholic religion and he serving 
 mass in adam and UNK-386 when he was young with his eyes shut who wrote 
 the new testament and the old testament and UNK-624 and UNK-474 . and 
 the two UNK-14 killed with the laughing picking his pockets the bloody 
 fool and he UNK-849 the porter all over the bed and the two UNK-14 
 UNK-561 laughing at one another . how is your testament ? have you got 
 an old testament ? only UNK-65 was passing there i tell you what . then 
 see him of a sunday with his little UNK-858 of a wife and she UNK-658 
 her tail up the UNK-67 of the chapel with her patent boots on her no 
 less and her UNK-427 nice as pie doing the little lady . jack UNK-989 
 sister . and the old UNK-937 of a mother UNK-358 rooms to street 
 couples . UNK-211 jack made him toe the line . told him if he UNK-3 patch up 
 the pot jesus UNK-25 kick the UNK-530 out of him . 
 UNK-0 
 so terry brought the three UNK-629 . 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 UNK-452 UNK-180 says he . 
 UNK-0

 and the cattle UNK-563 and taking action in the matter and the citizen 
 sending them all to the UNK-615 and bloom coming out with his 
 UNK-428 for the UNK-705 and a UNK-98 UNK-213 for UNK-14 UNK-134 and the

 UNK-176 gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these

 as to their UNK-97 condition ? 
 UNK-0

 UNK-176 members question is in the UNK-636 . 
 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-732 UNK-884 UNK-754 . nat . have similar orders been issued 
 for the UNK-184 of human animals who dare to play irish games in the 
 phoenix park ?

 UNK-0

 lawn tennis and about UNK-384 and putting the stone and UNK-486 of the soil 
 and building up a nation once again and all to that . and of course bloom 
 had to have his say too about if a fellow had a UNK-987 heart violent 
 exercise was bad . i declare to my UNK-620 if you took up a UNK-197

 UNK-0 
 a most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of brian 
 UNK-165 in UNK-690 na UNK-230 UNK-319 under the UNK-502 of 
 UNK-760 na UNK-633 on the UNK-35 of ancient UNK-886 sports and the 
 importance of physical culture as understood in ancient greece and 
 ancient rome and ancient ireland for the development of the race . 
 the UNK-380 president of the noble order was in the chair and the 
 attendance was of large dimensions . after an UNK-351 UNK-649 by 
 the chairman a magnificent UNK-477 UNK-265 and UNK-441 expressed 
 a most interesting and UNK-351 discussion of the usual high standard 
 of excellence UNK-397 as to the UNK-575 of the UNK-462 of 
 the ancient games and sports of our ancient UNK-968 UNK-802 . the 
 UNK-798 and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue mr 
 joseph UNK-179 UNK-45 made an UNK-50 appeal for the UNK-914 of 
 the ancient UNK-886 sports and UNK-459 UNK-156 morning and evening 
 by UNK-19 UNK-490 as calculated to UNK-560 the best traditions of UNK-306 
 strength and UNK-224 handed down to us from ancient ages . l . bloom who 
 met with a mixed reception of UNK-541 and UNK-611 having UNK-67 the 
 negative the UNK-726 chairman brought the discussion to a close in 
 response to repeated requests and UNK-656 UNK-268 from all parts of 
 a bumper house by a UNK-56 UNK-885 rendering of the UNK-605 
 thomas UNK-975 davis UNK-36 UNK-351 UNK-844 too familiar to need 
 UNK-371 here a nation once again in the execution of which the 
 veteran UNK-568 champion may be said without fear of UNK-971 
 to have fairly UNK-892 himself . the irish UNK-666 was in 
 UNK-931 form and his UNK-241 notes were heard to the greatest 
 advantage in the UNK-132 UNK-361 UNK-903 as only our citizen can sing 
 it . his superb UNK-440 UNK-728 which by its UNK-669 greatly 
 enhanced his already international reputation was UNK-95 
 UNK-737 by the large audience among which were to be noticed many 
 prominent members of the UNK-906 as well as representatives of the press 
 and the bar and the other learned UNK-98 . the proceedings then 
 UNK-445 .

 UNK-0 
 who ? UNK-103 ? says joe . 
 UNK-0 
 and says bloom 
 UNK-0 
 what i meant about tennis for example is the UNK-562 and training 
 the eye . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-42 UNK-103 says UNK-44 . he let out that UNK-314 was on the beer to run up 
 the odds and he UNK-136 all the time . 
 UNK-0 
 we know him says the citizen . the UNK-598 son . we know what put 
 english gold in his pocket . 
 UNK-0 
 true for you says joe . 
 UNK-0 
 and bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the 
 blood asking UNK-44 
 UNK-0 
 now dont you think UNK-180 ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-314 UNK-755 the floor with him says UNK-44 . UNK-0 and UNK-268 was only 
 a bloody fool to it . handed him the father and mother of a UNK-570 . see 
 the little UNK-631 not up to his UNK-610 and the big fellow UNK-95 . god 
 he gave him one last UNK-171 in the wind UNK-112 rules and all made 
 him UNK-201 what he never ate . 
 UNK-0 
 it was a historic and a UNK-952 battle when UNK-314 and UNK-836 were scheduled 
 to don the gloves for the purse of fifty UNK-690 . UNK-791 as he 
 was by lack of UNK-73 UNK-630 pet lamb made up for it by UNK-931 
 skill in UNK-798 . the final UNK-177 of UNK-525 was a UNK-552 for both 
 champions . the UNK-118 UNK-309 had UNK-408 some UNK-334 UNK-458 
 in the previous UNK-472 during which UNK-38 had been UNK-683 of 
 rights and UNK-68 the UNK-206 putting in some UNK-522 work on the 
 pets nose and UNK-314 came on looking UNK-397 . the soldier got to 
 business leading off with a powerful left UNK-411 to which the irish 
 UNK-137 UNK-442 by shooting out a UNK-257 one flush to the point of 
 UNK-201 UNK-110 . the UNK-397 UNK-295 but the UNK-600 UNK-64 him with a 
 left hook the body punch being a fine one . the men came to UNK-674 . 
 UNK-314 quickly became busy and got his man under the UNK-177 ending with 
 the UNK-311 man on the UNK-840 UNK-314 UNK-503 him . the UNK-999 whose 
 right eye was nearly closed took his corner where he was UNK-869 
 UNK-952 with water and when the bell went came on UNK-948 and UNK-356 of 
 UNK-397 confident of UNK-800 out the UNK-596 UNK-998 in UNK-510 . it was 
 a fight to a finish and the best man for it . the two fought like tigers 
 and excitement ran fever high . the UNK-498 twice UNK-782 UNK-762 UNK-836 
 for holding but the pet was UNK-497 and his UNK-166 a treat to watch . 
 after a UNK-517 exchange of UNK-719 during which a smart upper cut of 
 the military man brought blood freely from his opponents mouth the 
 lamb suddenly UNK-889 in all over his man and UNK-961 a UNK-92 left to 
 UNK-688 UNK-201 stomach flooring him flat . it was a UNK-113 clean 
 and UNK-324 . UNK-22 UNK-134 UNK-312 the UNK-423 UNK-198 was being 
 counted out when UNK-201 second UNK-961 UNK-212 UNK-376 UNK-163 in the 
 UNK-186 and the UNK-957 boy was declared victor to the UNK-478 cheers of 
 the public who broke through the UNK-919 and fairly UNK-12 him with 
 delight . 
 UNK-0

 crack their bloody UNK-709 one UNK-26 going for the other with his head 
 down like a bull at a gate . and another one black beast UNK-416 in 
 omaha ga . a lot of UNK-99 dicks in UNK-679 hats and they UNK-34 at a 
 UNK-857 UNK-785 up in a tree with his tongue out and a UNK-4 under 
 him . UNK-211 they ought to UNK-31 him in the sea after and UNK-392 and 
 UNK-735 him to make sure of their job . 
 UNK-0 
 but what about the fighting navy says UNK-33 that keeps our UNK-244 at 
 bay ? 
 UNK-0 
 ill tell you what about it says the citizen . hell upon earth it is . 
 read the UNK-100 thats going on in the papers about UNK-469 on 
 the training ships at portsmouth . a fellow writes that calls himself 
 UNK-772 one . 
 UNK-0 
 so he starts telling us about UNK-51 punishment and about the crew 
 of UNK-507 and officers and UNK-846 drawn up in UNK-786 hats and the 
 UNK-637 with his UNK-560 bible to witness punishment and a young UNK-5 
 brought out UNK-816 for his ma and they tie him down on the UNK-152 of 
 a gun . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-442 and dozen says the citizen was what that old UNK-17 sir john 
 UNK-912 called it but the modern gods UNK-999 calls it UNK-843 on 
 the UNK-313 . 
 UNK-0 
 and says john UNK-150 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-446 a custom more UNK-1 in the breach than in the UNK-151 . 
 UNK-0 
 then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long UNK-330 
 and he draws out and he UNK-411 the bloody UNK-830 off of the poor UNK-5 
 till he UNK-793 UNK-808 murder . 
 UNK-0 
 thats your UNK-520 british navy says the citizen that UNK-868 the 
 earth . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-13 that never will be UNK-439 with the only UNK-113 chamber 
 on the face of gods earth and their land in the hands of a dozen 
 UNK-43 and UNK-386 UNK-761 . thats the great empire they UNK-118 about 
 of UNK-234 and UNK-628 UNK-810 . 
 UNK-0 
 on which the sun never UNK-573 says joe . 
 UNK-0 
 and the tragedy of it is says the citizen they believe it . the 
 UNK-4 UNK-81 believe it . 
 UNK-0 
 they believe in rod the UNK-274 UNK-783 creator of hell upon earth 
 and in UNK-335 tar the son of a gun who was UNK-290 of UNK-955 UNK-118 
 born of the fighting navy suffered under UNK-442 and dozen was UNK-349 
 UNK-661 and UNK-110 UNK-659 like bloody hell the third day he UNK-507 
 again from the bed UNK-392 into haven UNK-379 on his UNK-802 till 
 further orders UNK-422 he shall come to UNK-361 for a living and be paid . 
 UNK-0 
 but says bloom UNK-50 discipline the same everywhere . i mean UNK-9 
 it be the same here if you put force against force ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-3 i tell you ? as true as im drinking this porter if he was at his 
 last UNK-896 UNK-25 try to UNK-80 you that dying was living . 
 UNK-0 
 well put force against force says the citizen . we have our greater 
 ireland beyond the sea . they were driven out of house and home in the 
 black UNK-629 . their UNK-357 and their UNK-529 by the UNK-942 were laid 
 low by the UNK-875 and the times UNK-866 its hands and told the 
 UNK-853 UNK-707 there would soon be as few irish in ireland as 
 UNK-8 in america . even the grand UNK-181 sent us his UNK-192 . but the 
 UNK-988 tried to UNK-324 the nation at home while the land was full 
 of crops that the british UNK-833 bought and sold in rio de UNK-866 . UNK-42 
 they drove out the UNK-926 in UNK-264 . twenty thousand of them died in 
 the UNK-32 . but those that came to the land of the free remember 
 the land of bondage . and they will come again and with a UNK-183 no 
 UNK-708 the sons of UNK-823 the champions of UNK-464 ni UNK-112 . 
 UNK-0 
 perfectly true says bloom . but my point was . . . 
 UNK-0 
 we are a long time waiting for that day citizen says UNK-33 . since the 
 poor old woman told us that the french were on the sea and UNK-961 at 
 UNK-443 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-42 says john UNK-150 . we fought for the royal UNK-124 that UNK-605 us 
 against the UNK-552 and they UNK-106 us . remember UNK-670 and the 
 broken UNK-502 . we gave our best blood to france and spain the 
 wild UNK-793 . UNK-260 eh ? and UNK-270 and UNK-5 duke of UNK-253 
 in spain and UNK-266 UNK-78 of UNK-470 that was UNK-39 to maria 
 UNK-574 . but what did we ever get for it ? 
 UNK-0 
 the french ! says the citizen . set of dancing masters ! do you know 
 what it is ? they were never worth a UNK-271 UNK-376 to ireland . UNK-602 they 
 trying to make an UNK-789 UNK-161 now at UNK-461 pays UNK-563 with 
 UNK-388 UNK-572 ? UNK-813 of europe and they always were .

 had enough of those UNK-816 UNK-506 on the UNK-980 from george the 
 UNK-441 down to the german UNK-5 and the UNK-186 old bitch thats dead ? 
 UNK-0

 with the UNK-820 on her blind drunk in her royal palace every night of 
 god old vic with her UNK-23 of mountain UNK-826 and her UNK-177 UNK-77 
 her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the 
 UNK-304 and singing him old bits of songs about UNK-158 on the UNK-51 
 and come where the UNK-118 is cheaper .

 UNK-44 . 
 UNK-0

 battery and joe for UNK-443 and UNK-671 . the UNK-469 saved his life by 
 UNK-942 driving as sure as god made moses . what ? o jesus he did . and

 the UNK-565 UNK-700 he stood UNK-770 to heaven . and they UNK-809 him in 
 the UNK-565 UNK-389 upon in the glory of the UNK-831 having UNK-242 
 as of the sun fair as the moon and terrible that for UNK-994 they UNK-884 not

 UNK-514 ! and he answered with a main cry UNK-408 ! UNK-592 ! and they 
 UNK-809 him even him ben bloom UNK-514 UNK-22 clouds of angels UNK-770 
 to the glory of the UNK-831 at an angle of UNK-842 degrees over 
 UNK-567 in little green street like a shot off a UNK-286 .

 the summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious 
 UNK-73 . far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of 
 all too UNK-631 day UNK-668 UNK-949 on sea and strand on the proud 
 UNK-226 of dear old UNK-301 UNK-666 as ever the waters of the bay on 
 the UNK-656 rocks along UNK-476 shore and last but not least on 
 the quiet church UNK-422 there UNK-984 forth at times upon the UNK-87 
 the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure UNK-102 a UNK-130 ever to 
 the UNK-612 heart of man mary star of the sea . 
 UNK-0 
 the three girl friends were UNK-154 on the rocks enjoying the evening 
 scene and the air which was fresh but not too UNK-618 . many a time and 
 UNK-226 were they UNK-19 to come there to that favourite UNK-933 to have a UNK-331 
 chat beside the UNK-302 waves and discuss matters UNK-95 UNK-39 
 UNK-94 and UNK-138 UNK-239 with the baby in the UNK-493 and tommy and 
 UNK-335 UNK-94 two little UNK-922 boys dressed in UNK-99 suits with 
 caps to match and the name h UNK-462 UNK-464 . UNK-140 printed on both . for tommy 
 and UNK-335 UNK-94 were twins UNK-268 four years old and very UNK-132 and 
 UNK-602 twins sometimes but for all that UNK-285 little UNK-13 with 
 bright merry faces and UNK-802 ways about them . they were UNK-17 in 
 the sand with their UNK-285 and UNK-714 building UNK-795 as children do 
 or playing with their big UNK-332 ball happy as the day was long . and 
 UNK-138 UNK-239 was UNK-147 the chubby baby to and UNK-161 in the UNK-493 while 
 that young gentleman fairly UNK-468 with delight . he was but eleven 
 months and nine days old and though still a tiny toddler was just 
 beginning to UNK-747 his first UNK-386 words . UNK-39 UNK-94 bent over to 
 him to UNK-764 his fat little UNK-512 and the UNK-888 UNK-957 in his UNK-333 . 
 UNK-0 
 now baby UNK-39 UNK-94 said . say out big big . i want a drink of 
 water . 
 UNK-0 
 and baby UNK-595 after her 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-388 a UNK-388 a UNK-458 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-39 UNK-94 UNK-785 the UNK-337 UNK-26 for she was UNK-229 UNK-345 of children 
 so patient with little UNK-768 and tommy UNK-94 could never be got to 
 take his UNK-860 oil unless it was UNK-39 UNK-94 that held his nose and 
 promised him the UNK-27 heel of the UNK-170 or brown bread with golden 
 UNK-557 on . what a UNK-942 power that girl had ! but to be sure baby 
 UNK-239 was as good as gold a perfect little UNK-110 in his new fancy 
 UNK-576 . none of your UNK-739 UNK-402 UNK-397 UNK-926 sort was UNK-39 
 UNK-94 . a UNK-437 UNK-341 never drew the breath of life always with 
 a laugh in her UNK-329 eyes and a UNK-492 word on her UNK-134 
 red lips a girl UNK-266 in the extreme . and UNK-138 UNK-239 UNK-20 too at 
 the UNK-495 language of little brother . 
 UNK-0 
 but just then there was a slight UNK-205 between master tommy and 
 master UNK-335 . boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception 
 to this golden rule . the apple of UNK-363 was a certain castle of sand 
 which master UNK-335 had built and master tommy would have it right go 
 wrong that it was to be UNK-769 improved by a UNK-931 like the 
 UNK-695 tower had . but if master tommy was UNK-955 master UNK-335 was 
 UNK-221 too and true to the UNK-330 that every little UNK-953 house 
 is his castle he fell upon his UNK-956 UNK-907 and to such purpose that the 
 UNK-291 UNK-613 came to UNK-383 and UNK-194 to relate ! the UNK-167 castle 
 too . UNK-647 to say the UNK-155 of UNK-163 master tommy drew the 
 attention of the girl friends . 
 UNK-0 
 come here tommy his sister called UNK-141 . at once ! and you 
 UNK-335 for shame to throw poor tommy in the dirty sand . wait till i 
 catch you for that . 
 UNK-0 
 his eyes UNK-684 with UNK-138 tears master tommy came at her call for their 
 big sisters word was law with the twins . and in a sad UNK-910 he was 
 too after his UNK-289 . his little UNK-556 top and UNK-459 
 were full of sand but UNK-39 was a past mistress in the art of UNK-899 
 over UNK-667 tiny UNK-117 and very quickly not one UNK-531 of sand was to 
 be seen on his smart little suit . still the blue eyes were UNK-985 
 with hot tears that would well up so she UNK-166 away the UNK-246 and 
 UNK-35 her hand at master UNK-335 the UNK-599 and said if she was near him 
 she UNK-9 be far from him her eyes dancing in UNK-291 . 
 UNK-0 
 nasty bold UNK-335 ! she UNK-5 . 
 UNK-0 
 she put an arm round the little UNK-542 and UNK-427 UNK-107 
 UNK-0 
 whats your name ? butter and cream ? 
 UNK-0 
 tell us who is your UNK-495 spoke UNK-138 UNK-239 . is UNK-39 your 
 UNK-495 ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-744 UNK-416 tommy said . 
 UNK-0 
 is UNK-138 UNK-239 your UNK-495 ? UNK-39 UNK-426 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-744 tommy said . 
 UNK-0 
 i know UNK-138 UNK-239 said none too UNK-760 with an arch glance from 
 her UNK-1 eyes . i know who is UNK-848 UNK-495 . UNK-52 is 
 UNK-848 UNK-495 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-744 tommy said on the UNK-762 of tears . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-851 quick UNK-421 UNK-853 what was UNK-532 and she UNK-222 to 
 UNK-138 UNK-239 to take him there behind the UNK-493 where the gentleman 
 UNK-18 see and to mind he UNK-3 wet his new tan shoes . 
 UNK-0 
 but who was UNK-52 ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-52 UNK-498 who was UNK-154 near her UNK-193 lost in thought 
 UNK-248 far away into the distance was in very truth as fair a UNK-540 
 of UNK-686 irish UNK-865 as one could wish to see . she was UNK-363 
 beautiful by all who knew her though as folks often said she was 
 more a UNK-865 than a UNK-498 . her figure was slight and UNK-231 
 UNK-580 even to UNK-138 but those iron UNK-430 she had been taking 
 of late had done her a world of good much better than the UNK-265 UNK-119 
 female pills and she was much better of those UNK-842 she used to 
 get and that tired feeling . the UNK-729 UNK-917 of her face was almost 
 spiritual in its UNK-336 UNK-591 though her UNK-731 mouth was a genuine 
 UNK-864 bow UNK-772 perfect . her hands were of UNK-163 UNK-649 UNK-181 
 with UNK-81 fingers and as white as UNK-504 and queen of UNK-408 
 could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves 
 in bed or take a milk UNK-360 either . UNK-619 UNK-823 told that once to 
 UNK-138 UNK-239 a UNK-781 lie when she was black out at UNK-711 drawn 
 with UNK-52 the girl UNK-951 had of course their little UNK-170 from time to 
 time like the rest of UNK-919 and she told her not to let on whatever 
 she did that it was her that told her or shed never speak to her 
 again . no . UNK-88 where UNK-88 is due . there was an UNK-749 UNK-715 
 a UNK-736 UNK-673 UNK-621 about UNK-52 which was UNK-122 UNK-36 
 in her UNK-325 hands and UNK-116 UNK-462 . had kind fate but UNK-21 
 her to be born a UNK-672 of high degree in her own right and had 
 she only received the benefit of a good education UNK-52 UNK-498 might 
 easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen 
 herself UNK-61 UNK-321 with UNK-542 on her UNK-195 and UNK-464 UNK-469 
 at her feet UNK-882 with one another to pay their UNK-395 to her . 
 UNK-229 it was this the love that might have been that UNK-256 to her 
 UNK-792 face at UNK-975 a look UNK-134 with UNK-679 meaning 
 that UNK-347 a strange UNK-157 UNK-271 to the beautiful eyes a charm 
 few could resist . why have women such eyes of UNK-483 ? UNK-264 were of 
 the UNK-244 irish blue set off by UNK-782 UNK-242 and dark UNK-552 
 UNK-490 . time was when those UNK-490 were not so UNK-153 UNK-337 . it 
 was UNK-385 UNK-766 UNK-471 UNK-939 of the woman beautiful page of the 
 princess UNK-505 who had first advised her to try UNK-510 which 
 gave that UNK-25 expression to the eyes so becoming in leaders 
 of fashion and she had never UNK-255 it . then there was UNK-521 
 UNK-766 UNK-514 and how to be tall increase your height and you 
 have a beautiful face but your nose ? that would suit mrs UNK-28 because 
 she had a button one . but UNK-264 UNK-829 glory was her wealth of 
 wonderful hair . it was dark brown with a natural wave in it . she had cut 
 it that very morning on account of the new moon and it UNK-671 about 
 her pretty head in a UNK-231 of UNK-829 clusters and UNK-720 her nails 
 too thursday for wealth . and just now at UNK-687 words as a UNK-676 
 flush UNK-325 as the UNK-990 UNK-766 UNK-270 into her UNK-145 she 
 looked so lovely in her sweet UNK-175 UNK-787 that of a UNK-364 gods 
 fair land of ireland did not hold her equal . 
 UNK-0 
 for an instant she was silent with rather sad UNK-571 eyes . she 
 was about to UNK-790 but something checked the words on her tongue . 
 UNK-991 UNK-295 her to speak out UNK-491 told her to be silent . 
 the pretty lips UNK-58 UNK-401 but then she UNK-75 up and broke out into 
 a UNK-111 little laugh which had in it all the UNK-365 of a young may 
 morning . she knew right well UNK-159 better what made UNK-695 UNK-138 
 say that because of him cooling in his UNK-11 when it was simply a 
 lovers UNK-924 . as per usual UNK-680 nose was out of joint about the 
 boy that had the bicycle off the london bridge road always riding up 
 and down in front of her window . only now his father kept him in in the 
 UNK-648 studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was 
 on and he was going to go to trinity college to study for a doctor when 
 he left the high school like his brother w . e . UNK-870 who was racing 
 in the bicycle races in trinity college university . little UNK-870 he 
 perhaps for what she felt that UNK-66 UNK-620 void in her heart sometimes 
 UNK-533 to the core . yet he was young and UNK-563 he might learn 
 to love her in time . they were UNK-949 in his family and of course 
 UNK-52 knew who came first and after him the blessed virgin and then 
 saint joseph . but he was UNK-336 UNK-218 with an UNK-32 nose and 
 he was what he looked every inch a gentleman the shape of his head too 
 at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something 
 off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his 
 hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes 
 and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why UNK-138 
 UNK-239 thought she was so UNK-284 UNK-324 because he UNK-3 go and 
 ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-52 was dressed simply but with the UNK-687 taste of a UNK-11 of 
 dame fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be 
 out . a UNK-522 UNK-413 of electric blue UNK-261 by UNK-961 UNK-795 because it 
 was expected in the UNK-532 UNK-393 that electric blue would be worn 
 with a smart UNK-15 opening down to the division and UNK-5 pocket in 
 which she always kept a piece of UNK-34 UNK-429 with her 
 favourite perfume because the UNK-185 UNK-602 the sit and a navy 
 UNK-992 skirt cut to the UNK-767 showed off her slim UNK-231 figure 
 to UNK-210 . she UNK-71 a UNK-507 little love of a hat of UNK-919 
 UNK-848 UNK-197 contrast UNK-156 with an UNK-480 of UNK-454 UNK-519 and 
 at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone . all tuesday week afternoon 
 she was hunting to match that UNK-519 but at last she found what she 
 wanted at UNK-943 summer sales the very it slightly UNK-28 but you 
 would never notice seven fingers two and a penny . she did it up all by 
 herself and what joy was UNK-349 when she tried it on then UNK-21 at the 
 lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her ! and when she put 
 it on the UNK-489 to keep the shape she knew that that would take the 
 shine out of some people she knew . her shoes were the newest thing in 
 footwear UNK-138 UNK-239 UNK-898 herself that she was very petite but she 
 never had a foot like UNK-52 UNK-498 a five and never would ash 
 oak or UNK-97 with patent UNK-488 and just one smart UNK-905 over 
 her UNK-116 UNK-462 . her UNK-501 UNK-636 displayed its perfect 
 UNK-709 beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of 
 her UNK-116 UNK-477 UNK-116 in UNK-103 hose with highspliced UNK-183 and 
 wide UNK-373 tops . as for UNK-566 they were UNK-264 chief care and who 
 that knows the UNK-923 hopes and fears of sweet UNK-538 though 
 UNK-52 would never see UNK-538 again can find it in his heart to 
 blame her ? she had four UNK-885 sets with UNK-229 pretty UNK-500 
 three UNK-829 and UNK-668 extra and each set UNK-135 with different 
 UNK-332 UNK-978 UNK-267 pale blue UNK-773 and UNK-558 and she UNK-699 
 them herself and UNK-533 them when they came home from the wash and UNK-636 
 them and she had a UNK-299 to keep the iron on because she UNK-9 
 trust those UNK-517 as far as shed see them UNK-723 the things . 
 she was wearing the blue for luck hoping against hope her own colour 
 and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because 
 the green she UNK-71 that day week brought UNK-383 because his father 
 brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because 
 she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that 
 morning she nearly UNK-728 up the old pair on her inside out and that 
 was for luck and lovers meeting if you put those things on inside 
 out or if they got UNK-122 that he was thinking about you so long as it 
 UNK-69 of a friday . 
 UNK-0 
 and yet and yet ! that UNK-434 look on her face ! a UNK-447 UNK-234 is 
 there all the time . her very soul is in her eyes and she would give 
 worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where 
 giving way to tears she could have a good cry and UNK-515 her UNK-640 
 UNK-515 not too much because she knew how to cry UNK-348 before 
 the mirror . you are lovely UNK-52 it said . the UNK-550 light of evening 
 falls upon a face UNK-145 sad and UNK-589 . UNK-52 UNK-498 UNK-854 
 in UNK-398 . yes she had known from the very first that her UNK-850 of a 
 marriage has been arranged and the UNK-150 UNK-924 for mrs UNK-100 
 UNK-870 t . c . d . because the one who married the elder brother would be 
 mrs UNK-870 and in the UNK-500 intelligence mrs UNK-600 UNK-870 was 
 wearing a UNK-40 UNK-66 of grey UNK-156 with expensive blue fox 
 was not to be . he was too young to understand . he would not believe in 
 love a UNK-95 UNK-490 . the night of the party long ago in UNK-809 
 he was still in short UNK-48 when they were alone and he UNK-273 
 an arm round her UNK-599 she went white to the very lips . he called her 
 little one in a UNK-784 UNK-668 voice and UNK-112 a half kiss the 
 first ! but it was only the end of her nose and then he UNK-407 from 
 the room with a remark about UNK-203 . UNK-801 fellow ! strength of 
 character had never been UNK-100 UNK-461 strong point and he who would 
 UNK-182 and win UNK-52 UNK-498 must be a man among men . but waiting always 
 waiting to be asked and it was UNK-981 year too and would soon be over . no 
 prince charming is her UNK-353 ideal to lay a rare and UNK-810 love at her 
 feet but rather a UNK-306 man with a strong quiet face who had not found 
 his ideal perhaps his hair slightly UNK-290 with grey and who would 
 understand take her in his UNK-275 arms strain her to him in all 
 the strength of his deep UNK-954 nature and comfort her with a long 
 long kiss . it would be like heaven . for such a one she UNK-854 this UNK-946 
 summer eve . with all the heart of her she UNK-254 to be his only his 
 UNK-158 bride for UNK-281 for poor in UNK-309 in health till death 
 us two part from this to this day forward . 
 UNK-0 
 and while UNK-138 UNK-239 was with little tommy behind the UNK-493 she was 
 just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his 
 little wife to be . then they could talk about her till they went blue in 
 the face UNK-619 UNK-823 too and UNK-138 little UNK-880 because she would 
 be UNK-405 in november . she would care for him with creature UNK-416 
 too for UNK-52 was UNK-145 wise and knew that a mere man liked that 
 feeling of UNK-842 . her UNK-450 done to a UNK-602 UNK-641 and 
 queen UNK-459 UNK-494 of UNK-80 UNK-579 had won golden opinions 
 from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire UNK-914 
 in the fine UNK-213 flour and always UNK-94 in the same direction 
 then cream the milk and sugar and UNK-167 well the white of eggs though 
 she UNK-3 like the eating part when there were any people that made her 
 UNK-523 and often she UNK-105 why you UNK-18 eat something UNK-148 like 
 UNK-427 or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed UNK-411 
 with pictures and UNK-554 and the photograph of UNK-760 UNK-846 
 lovely dog UNK-745 that almost talked it was so human and UNK-429 
 covers for the chairs and that silver UNK-762 in UNK-943 summer 
 UNK-234 sales like they have in rich houses . he would be tall with 
 broad UNK-61 she had always UNK-336 tall men for a husband with 
 UNK-985 white teeth under his carefully UNK-156 UNK-31 UNK-91 
 and they would go on the continent for their UNK-250 three wonderful 
 weeks ! and then when they settled down in a nice UNK-817 and UNK-331 little 
 UNK-393 house every morning they would both have UNK-804 simple but 
 perfectly served for their own two UNK-965 and before he went out to 
 business he would give his dear little UNK-266 a good UNK-656 UNK-35 and UNK-49 
 for a moment deep down into her eyes . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-138 UNK-239 asked tommy UNK-94 was he done and he said yes so then she 
 UNK-872 up his little UNK-720 for him and told him to run off 
 and play with UNK-335 and to be good now and not to fight . but tommy said 
 he wanted the ball and UNK-138 told him no that baby was playing with the 
 ball and if he took it UNK-581 be UNK-770 on the green but tommy said it 
 was his ball and he wanted his ball and he UNK-555 on the ground if 
 you please . the UNK-933 of him ! o he was a man already was little tommy 
 UNK-94 since he was out of UNK-397 . UNK-138 told him no no and to be off 
 now with him and she told UNK-39 UNK-94 not to give in to him . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-14 not my sister naughty tommy said . its my ball . 
 UNK-0 
 but UNK-39 UNK-94 told baby UNK-239 to look up look up high at her 
 finger and she UNK-112 the ball quickly and UNK-163 it along the sand and 
 tommy after it in full career having won the day . 
 UNK-0 
 anything for a quiet life UNK-20 UNK-593 . 
 UNK-0 
 and she UNK-448 tiny UNK-566 two UNK-145 to make him forget and played 
 UNK-182 the lord mayor UNK-182 his two horses UNK-182 his UNK-936 
 UNK-114 and here he walks in UNK-546 chinchopper UNK-546 
 UNK-333 . but UNK-138 got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way 
 like that from everyone always UNK-980 him . 
 UNK-0 
 id like to give him something she said so i would where i UNK-19 
 say . 
 UNK-0 
 on the UNK-438 UNK-20 UNK-39 UNK-314 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-52 UNK-498 bent down her head and UNK-758 at the idea of UNK-39 
 saying an UNK-118 thing like that out loud shed be UNK-252 of her 
 life to say UNK-347 a deep UNK-716 red and UNK-138 UNK-239 said she was 
 sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said . but not a pin UNK-394 
 UNK-593 . 
 UNK-0 
 let him ! she said with a UNK-113 UNK-875 of her head and a UNK-661 UNK-304 of 
 her nose . give it to him too on the same place as quick as id look at 
 him . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-785 UNK-593 with her UNK-858 UNK-398 . you had to laugh at her sometimes . 
 for instance when she asked you would you have some more chinese tea and 
 UNK-246 ram and when she drew the UNK-933 too and the mens faces on her 
 nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go 
 where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the miss 
 white . that was just like UNK-109 . o and will you ever forget her the 
 evening she dressed up in her fathers suit and hat and the UNK-416 cork 
 UNK-91 and walked down UNK-874 road smoking a cigarette . there 
 was none to come up to her for fun . but she was UNK-904 itself one of 
 the UNK-252 and UNK-591 hearts heaven ever made not one of your UNK-305 
 things too sweet to be UNK-113 . 
 UNK-0 
 and then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the UNK-958 
 UNK-361 of the organ . it was the mens UNK-267 retreat conducted 
 by the UNK-49 the UNK-140 john hughes s . j . UNK-536 UNK-566 and 
 UNK-806 of the most blessed UNK-511 . they were there gathered 
 together without distinction of social class and a most UNK-841 
 UNK-876 it was to see in that simple UNK-567 beside the waves after the 
 UNK-288 of this UNK-129 world UNK-755 before the feet of the UNK-39 
 UNK-165 the UNK-688 of our lady of UNK-982 UNK-12 her to UNK-725 
 for them the old familiar words holy mary holy virgin of UNK-420 . how 
 sad to poor UNK-264 ears ! had her father only UNK-802 the UNK-373 of 
 the UNK-105 drink by taking the pledge or those UNK-230 the drink UNK-158 
 UNK-514 in UNK-728 weekly she might now be rolling in her UNK-114 
 second to none . over and over had she told herself that as she UNK-486 by 
 the dying UNK-601 in a brown study without the lamp because she UNK-956 two 
 lights or UNK-1 UNK-248 out of the window UNK-627 by the hour at 
 the rain falling on the UNK-183 UNK-283 thinking . but that UNK-200 UNK-638 
 which has UNK-21 so many UNK-706 and homes had UNK-888 its shadow over her 
 childhood days . UNK-376 she had even UNK-897 in the home circle UNK-898 of 
 violence caused by UNK-59 and had seen her own father a UNK-659 to 
 the UNK-96 of UNK-737 forget himself completely for if there was 
 one thing of all things that UNK-52 knew it was that the man who UNK-400 
 his hand to a woman save in the way of UNK-663 UNK-988 to be UNK-23 
 as the lowest of the low . 
 UNK-0 
 and still the voices UNK-57 in UNK-752 to the virgin most powerful 
 virgin most UNK-607 . and UNK-52 UNK-827 in thought UNK-268 saw or heard 
 her UNK-193 or the twins at their UNK-848 UNK-152 or the gentleman 
 off UNK-476 green that UNK-39 UNK-94 called the man that was so like 
 himself passing along the strand taking a short walk . you never saw him 
 any way UNK-960 but still and for all that she would not like him for a 
 father because he was too old or something or on account of his face 
 it was a UNK-50 case of doctor fell or his UNK-493 nose with the 
 UNK-794 on it and his sandy UNK-91 a bit white under his nose . poor 
 father ! with all his UNK-613 she loved him still when he UNK-57 tell me 
 mary how to UNK-182 thee or my love and cottage near UNK-374 and they 
 had UNK-807 UNK-717 and UNK-570 with UNK-737 salad dressing for 
 UNK-255 and when he UNK-57 the moon UNK-718 raised with mr UNK-28 that 
 died suddenly and was buried god have mercy on him from a stroke . her 
 mothers birthday that was and UNK-847 was home on his holidays and tom 
 and mr UNK-28 and mrs and UNK-554 and UNK-134 UNK-28 and they were to have 
 had a group taken . UNK-159 would have thought the end was so near . now he 
 was laid to rest . and her mother said to him to let that be a warning to 
 him for the rest of his days and he UNK-18 even go to the funeral on 
 account of the UNK-231 and she had to go into town to bring him the 
 letters and samples from his office about UNK-976 cork UNK-989 artistic 
 standard designs fit for a palace gives UNK-648 wear and always bright 
 and UNK-840 in the home . 
 UNK-0 
 a sterling good daughter was UNK-52 just like a second mother in the 
 house a UNK-110 angel too with a little heart worth its weight in 
 gold . and when her mother had those UNK-668 UNK-773 UNK-502 who was 
 it UNK-866 the UNK-537 UNK-979 on her UNK-133 but UNK-52 though she UNK-3 
 like her mothers taking UNK-901 of UNK-68 and that was the only single 
 thing they ever had words about taking UNK-68 . everyone thought the 
 world of her for her gentle ways . it was UNK-52 who turned off the gas at 
 the main every night and it was UNK-52 who UNK-327 up on the wall of that 
 place where she never forgot every UNK-568 the UNK-767 of lime mr 
 UNK-353 the UNK-84 christmas UNK-677 the picture of UNK-562 days 
 where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a 
 UNK-446 hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his UNK-190 with 
 UNK-464 UNK-265 through her UNK-473 window . you could see there was a 
 story behind it . the colours were done something lovely . she was in 
 a soft UNK-862 white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in 
 chocolate and he looked a thorough UNK-256 . she often looked at them 
 UNK-627 when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own 
 arms that were white and soft just like UNK-349 with the UNK-552 back 
 and thought about those times because she had found out in UNK-257 
 UNK-619 dictionary that UNK-386 to UNK-760 UNK-865 about the 
 UNK-562 days what they meant . 
 UNK-0 
 the twins were now playing in the most approved UNK-698 fashion 
 till at last master UNK-335 who was really as bold as brass there was 
 no getting behind that UNK-177 UNK-986 the ball as hard as ever he 
 could down towards the UNK-308 rocks . UNK-647 to say poor tommy was 
 not slow to voice his UNK-319 but UNK-657 the gentleman in black who was 
 sitting there by himself came UNK-37 to the rescue and UNK-734 
 the ball . our two champions claimed their UNK-998 with UNK-102 UNK-155 and 
 to avoid trouble UNK-39 UNK-94 called to the gentleman to throw it to 
 her please . the gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then UNK-163 
 it up the strand towards UNK-39 UNK-94 but it rolled down the slope and 
 stopped right under UNK-264 skirt near the little pool by the rock . the 
 twins UNK-953 again for it and UNK-39 told her to kick it away and 
 let them fight for it so UNK-52 drew back her foot but she UNK-136 their 
 stupid ball UNK-180 come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she 
 missed and UNK-138 and UNK-39 UNK-20 . 
 UNK-0 
 if you fail try again UNK-138 UNK-239 said . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-52 UNK-24 UNK-338 and bit her lip . a UNK-325 pink UNK-270 into her 
 pretty UNK-139 but she was determined to let them see so she just UNK-64 
 her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a 
 UNK-236 good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down 
 towards the UNK-623 . pure UNK-315 of course it was nothing else to draw 
 attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking . she felt the 
 warm flush a danger signal always with UNK-52 UNK-498 UNK-510 and 
 UNK-600 into her UNK-145 . till then they had only UNK-45 UNK-26 of 
 the most casual but now under the UNK-233 of her new hat she UNK-625 a 
 look at him and the face that met her UNK-49 there in the UNK-391 wan 
 and UNK-784 drawn seemed to her the UNK-399 she had ever seen . 
 UNK-0 
 through the open window of the church the UNK-23 UNK-402 was UNK-478 
 and with it the UNK-23 names of her who was UNK-290 without UNK-103 of 
 original sin spiritual vessel pray for us UNK-176 vessel pray 
 for us vessel of UNK-663 UNK-796 pray for us UNK-738 rose . and 
 UNK-114 hearts were there and UNK-633 for their daily bread and many 
 who had UNK-640 and UNK-326 their eyes wet with UNK-256 but for all 
 that bright with hope for the UNK-140 father father hughes had told 
 them what the great saint bernard said in his famous prayer of mary the 
 most UNK-290 UNK-420 UNK-255 power that it was not recorded in any 
 age that those who UNK-309 her powerful protection were ever abandoned 
 by her . 
 UNK-0 
 the twins were now playing again right UNK-314 for the UNK-117 of 
 childhood are but as UNK-631 summer showers . UNK-39 UNK-94 played with 
 baby UNK-239 till he UNK-113 with UNK-401 UNK-374 baby hands in air . UNK-105 
 she UNK-5 behind the hood of the UNK-493 and UNK-138 asked where was UNK-39 
 gone and then UNK-39 UNK-388 up her head and UNK-5 ah ! and my word 
 UNK-3 the little UNK-26 enjoy that ! and then she told him to say UNK-758 . 
 UNK-0 
 say UNK-758 baby . say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa . 
 UNK-0 
 and baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for 
 eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of 
 health a perfect little bunch of love and he would certainly turn out 
 to be something great they said . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-593 ja ja UNK-593 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-39 UNK-702 his little mouth with the UNK-16 UNK-576 and wanted him to 
 sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she UNK-939 the strap she UNK-5 
 out holy saint UNK-531 that he was UNK-366 wet and to double the half 
 blanket the other way under him . of course his infant UNK-275 was most 
 UNK-723 at such toilet UNK-425 and he let everyone know it 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-434 UNK-1 UNK-342 . 
 UNK-0 
 and two great big lovely big tears UNK-500 down his UNK-145 . it was all 
 no use UNK-374 him with no UNK-17 baby no and telling him about the 
 UNK-720 and where was the UNK-341 but UNK-593 always UNK-739 gave 
 him in his mouth the UNK-883 of the UNK-865 and the young UNK-588 was 
 quickly UNK-709 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-52 UNK-136 to UNK-403 they would take their UNK-779 baby home out 
 of that and not get on her UNK-510 no hour to be out and the little 
 UNK-482 of twins . she UNK-84 out towards the distant sea . it was like the 
 paintings that man used to do on the UNK-125 with all the UNK-332 
 UNK-720 and such a UNK-47 too leaving them there to be all UNK-466 out the 
 evening and the clouds coming out and the bailey light on UNK-301 and to 
 hear the music like that and the perfume of those UNK-402 they UNK-416 
 in the church like a kind of UNK-960 . and while she UNK-84 her heart went 
 UNK-80 . yes it was her he was looking at and there was meaning in his 
 look . his eyes UNK-416 into her as though they would search her through 
 and through read her very soul . wonderful eyes they were UNK-417 
 UNK-552 but could you trust them ? people were so UNK-81 . she could 
 see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he 
 was a UNK-946 the image of the photo she had of martin harvey the 
 UNK-367 idol only for the UNK-91 which she preferred because she 
 UNK-69 UNK-312 like UNK-189 UNK-365 that wanted they two to always 
 dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had 
 an UNK-391 nose or a slightly UNK-354 from where he was sitting . 
 he was in deep UNK-210 she could see that and the story of a UNK-25 
 UNK-234 was written on his face . she would have given worlds to know what 
 it was . he was looking up so UNK-978 so still and he saw her kick the 
 ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel UNK-988 of her shoes if 
 she UNK-414 them like that UNK-711 with the UNK-297 down . she was glad 
 that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking 
 UNK-100 UNK-870 might be out but that was far away . here was that of which 
 she had so often UNK-181 . it was he who UNK-804 and there was joy on 
 her face because she wanted him because she felt UNK-186 that he 
 was like UNK-159 else . the very heart of the UNK-166 went out to him 
 her UNK-613 because she knew on the instant it was him . if he had 
 suffered more UNK-251 against than UNK-12 or even even if he had 
 been himself a UNK-473 a wicked man she UNK-394 not . even if he was a 
 UNK-560 or UNK-879 she could convert him easily if he truly loved 
 her . there were UNK-20 that wanted healing with UNK-409 . she was a 
 UNK-145 woman not like other UNK-594 girls UNK-466 he had known 
 those UNK-895 showing off what they UNK-180 got and she just UNK-521 to 
 know all to UNK-540 all if she could make him fall in love with her 
 make him forget the memory of the past . then UNK-229 he would UNK-73 her 
 gently like a real man UNK-770 her soft body to him and love her 
 his UNK-658 UNK-364 for herself alone . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-324 of UNK-608 . UNK-974 of the UNK-367 . UNK-181 pro UNK-876 . well 
 has it been said that UNK-936 UNK-639 to her with faith and UNK-546 
 can never be lost or cast away and UNK-827 is she too a haven of UNK-324 
 for the UNK-367 because of the seven UNK-533 which UNK-42 
 her own heart . UNK-52 could picture the whole scene in the church the 
 UNK-567 glass windows UNK-340 up the candles the flowers and the blue 
 banners of the blessed UNK-420 UNK-173 and father UNK-190 was helping 
 canon UNK-154 at the UNK-92 carrying things in and out with his eyes 
 cast down . he looked almost a saint and his UNK-292 was so quiet 
 and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever 
 she became a dominican UNK-642 in their white UNK-158 perhaps he might come to 
 the UNK-575 for the UNK-53 of saint UNK-999 . he told her that time when 
 she told him about that in UNK-343 UNK-798 up to the roots of her 
 hair for fear he could see not to be UNK-371 because that was only the 
 voice of nature and we were all subject to UNK-978 laws he said in 
 this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of 
 woman UNK-3 by god he said and that our blessed lady herself said 
 to the UNK-260 gabriel be it done unto me according to thy word . he 
 was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could 
 she work a UNK-867 UNK-398 with UNK-683 floral design for him as a 
 present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the UNK-425 
 white and gold with a UNK-220 that came out of a little house to tell 
 the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours 
 UNK-111 because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or 
 perhaps an album of UNK-300 views of dublin or some place . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-834 little UNK-482 of twins began to UNK-924 again and UNK-335 
 UNK-163 the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it . little 
 UNK-626 common as UNK-271 . someone ought to take them and give them 
 a good UNK-8 for themselves to keep them in their places the both of 
 them . and UNK-39 and UNK-138 UNK-247 after them to come back because they 
 were afraid the tide might come in on them and be UNK-69 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-335 ! tommy ! 
 UNK-0 
 not they ! what a great notion they had ! so UNK-39 said it was the very 
 last time shed ever bring them out . she UNK-615 up and called them and 
 she ran down the slope past him UNK-680 her hair behind her which had 
 a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the 
 UNK-933 she was always UNK-166 into it she UNK-18 get it to grow 
 long because it UNK-69 natural so she could just go and throw her hat at 
 it . she ran with long UNK-724 UNK-21 it was a wonder she UNK-3 rip up 
 her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot 
 of the UNK-785 about UNK-39 UNK-94 and she was a forward piece whenever 
 she thought she had a good opportunity to show and just because she was 
 a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her 
 UNK-470 running and her UNK-150 UNK-674 up as far as possible . it 
 would have served her just right if she had UNK-329 up over something 
 UNK-787 on purpose with her high UNK-529 french UNK-183 on her to 
 make her look tall and got a fine UNK-553 . UNK-741 ! that would have 
 been a very charming UNK-232 for a gentleman like that to witness . 
 UNK-0 
 queen of angels queen of UNK-143 queen of UNK-676 of all saints 
 they UNK-124 queen of the most holy UNK-536 and then father UNK-190 handed 
 the UNK-836 to canon UNK-154 and he put in the UNK-402 and UNK-819 the 
 blessed UNK-511 and UNK-39 UNK-94 caught the two twins and she was 
 UNK-508 to give them a UNK-924 good clip on the ear but she UNK-3 
 because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger 
 mistake in all her life because UNK-52 could see without looking that 
 he never took his eyes off of her and then canon UNK-154 handed the 
 UNK-836 back to father UNK-190 and UNK-97 down looking up at the blessed 
 UNK-511 and the choir began to sing the UNK-164 UNK-861 and she just 
 UNK-414 her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to 
 the UNK-460 UNK-717 UNK-84 UNK-967 . three and eleven she paid for those 
 stockings in UNK-879 of UNK-528 street on the tuesday no the monday 
 before easter and there UNK-69 a UNK-579 on them and that was what he 
 was looking at transparent and not at her UNK-954 ones that had 
 neither shape nor form the UNK-139 of her ! because he had eyes in his 
 head to see the difference for himself . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-39 came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with 
 her hat UNK-58 on her to one side after her run and she did look a 
 UNK-266 UNK-271 the two kids along with the UNK-798 UNK-413 she bought only 
 a UNK-568 before like a UNK-680 on her back and a bit of her UNK-470 
 hanging like a UNK-259 . UNK-52 just took off her hat for a moment to 
 settle her hair and a UNK-569 a UNK-98 head of UNK-440 UNK-470 was 
 never seen on a girls UNK-266 UNK-543 little vision in UNK-140 
 almost UNK-92 in its UNK-551 . you would have to travel many a long 
 mile before you found a head of hair the like of that . she could almost 
 see the swift answering flash of UNK-870 in his eyes that set her 
 UNK-567 in every nerve . she put on her hat so that she could see from 
 UNK-733 the UNK-233 and UNK-414 her UNK-989 shoe faster for her breath 
 caught as she caught the expression in his eyes . he was UNK-407 her as a 
 snake eyes its UNK-659 . her UNK-95 UNK-375 told her that she had raised 
 the devil in him and at the thought a burning UNK-205 UNK-716 from throat 
 to UNK-195 till the lovely colour of her face became a UNK-520 rose . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-138 UNK-239 was UNK-654 it too because she was UNK-412 at UNK-52 
 half UNK-21 with her specs like an old UNK-685 UNK-438 to nurse the 
 baby . UNK-384 little UNK-903 she was and always would be and that was why 
 UNK-159 could get on with her UNK-688 her nose into what was no concern of 
 UNK-349 . and she said to UNK-52 
 UNK-0 
 a penny for your thoughts . 
 UNK-0 
 what ? replied UNK-52 with a smile UNK-627 by the UNK-273 of teeth . i 
 was only wondering was it late . 
 UNK-0 
 because she UNK-136 to UNK-403 UNK-492 take the UNK-321 twins and 
 their UNK-528 home to the UNK-974 out of that so that was why she just 
 gave a gentle hint about its being late . and when UNK-39 came up UNK-138 
 asked her the time and miss UNK-39 as UNK-200 as you like said it was half 
 past kissing time time to kiss again . but UNK-138 wanted to know because 
 they were told to be in early . 
 UNK-0 
 wait said UNK-39 ill run ask my uncle peter over there whats the 
 time by his UNK-144 . 
 UNK-0 
 so over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his 
 hand out of his pocket getting nervous and beginning to play with his 
 UNK-933 looking up at the church . UNK-954 nature though he was 
 UNK-52 could see that he had enormous control over himself . one moment he 
 had been there UNK-160 by a UNK-912 that made him UNK-49 and the 
 next moment it was the quiet UNK-504 gentleman UNK-174 expressed 
 in every line of his UNK-982 figure . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-39 said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the 
 right time and UNK-52 could see him taking out his watch listening to it 
 and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his 
 watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the 
 sun was set . his voice had a UNK-977 ring in it and though he spoke in 
 measured UNK-122 there was a UNK-488 of a UNK-669 in the UNK-154 tones . 
 UNK-39 said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said 
 his UNK-800 were out of order . 
 UNK-0 
 then they UNK-57 the second verse of the UNK-164 UNK-861 and canon UNK-154 
 got up again and UNK-819 the blessed UNK-511 and UNK-97 down and he told 
 father UNK-190 that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the 
 flowers and father UNK-190 got up and settled it all right and she could 
 see the gentleman UNK-407 his watch and listening to the works and she 
 UNK-414 her leg more in and out in time . it was getting UNK-13 but he 
 could see and he was looking all the time that he was UNK-407 the watch 
 or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands 
 back into his pockets . she felt a kind of a UNK-393 UNK-531 all over 
 her and she knew by the feel of her UNK-619 and that UNK-747 against 
 her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too 
 was when she UNK-852 her hair on account of the moon . his dark eyes 
 fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every UNK-608 literally 
 UNK-513 at her UNK-366 . if ever there was UNK-847 UNK-870 in a 
 UNK-54 UNK-954 UNK-49 it was there plain to be seen on that UNK-54 face . 
 it is for you UNK-600 UNK-498 and you know it . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-138 began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and UNK-52 
 noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect 
 because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place 
 to push up the UNK-493 and UNK-39 took off the twins caps and UNK-229 
 their hair to make herself attractive of course and canon UNK-154 stood 
 up with his cope UNK-688 up at his neck and father UNK-190 handed him the 
 card to read off and he read out UNK-447 de UNK-596 UNK-338 UNK-431 and 
 UNK-138 and UNK-39 were talking about the time all the time and asking her 
 but UNK-52 could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered 
 with UNK-105 UNK-474 when UNK-138 asked her was she UNK-100 about 
 her best boy throwing her over . UNK-52 UNK-533 UNK-278 . a brief cold UNK-362 
 UNK-493 from her eyes that spoke volumes of UNK-589 UNK-331 . it UNK-913 
 yes it cut deep because UNK-138 had her own quiet way of saying things 
 like that she knew would wound like the UNK-806 little cat she was . 
 UNK-264 lips UNK-621 UNK-171 to frame the word but she fought back 
 the UNK-278 that rose to her throat so slim so UNK-211 so beautifully 
 UNK-989 it seemed one an artist might have UNK-181 of . she had loved him 
 better than he knew . UNK-961 UNK-5 and UNK-781 like all his sex 
 he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant 
 there was in the blue eyes a quick UNK-358 of tears . their eyes were 
 UNK-368 her UNK-561 but with a brave effort she UNK-107 back in 
 sympathy as she UNK-75 at her new UNK-447 for them to see . 
 UNK-0 
 o responded UNK-52 quick as lightning laughing and the proud head 
 UNK-179 up . i can throw my cap at who i like because its UNK-981 year . 
 UNK-0 
 her words UNK-459 out UNK-737 more musical than the UNK-658 of the 
 UNK-960 but they cut the silence UNK-819 . there was that in her young 
 voice that told that she was not a one to be UNK-79 UNK-604 with . as 
 for mr UNK-100 with his UNK-538 and his bit of money she could just chuck 
 him aside as if he was so much UNK-374 and never again would she cast as 
 much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen 
 pieces . and if ever after he UNK-357 to UNK-824 she could give him one 
 look of measured UNK-589 that would make him UNK-728 up on the spot . miss 
 UNK-946 little UNK-687 UNK-990 fell to no slight extent and UNK-52 could 
 see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a UNK-297 
 rage though she UNK-373 it the little UNK-381 because that shaft had 
 struck home for her UNK-946 UNK-315 and they both knew that she was 
 something UNK-293 apart in another sphere that she was not of them and 
 never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it 
 so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-138 UNK-195 up baby UNK-239 to get ready to go and UNK-39 UNK-852 in 
 the ball and the UNK-285 and UNK-714 and it was high time too because the 
 UNK-744 was on his way for master UNK-239 junior . and UNK-39 told him 
 too that billy UNK-203 was coming and that baby was to go UNK-213 and baby 
 looked just too UNK-897 laughing up out of his UNK-733 eyes and UNK-39 
 UNK-549 him like that out of fun in his UNK-337 fat UNK-671 and baby without as 
 much as by your leave sent up his UNK-857 to all and UNK-909 on to 
 his UNK-930 UNK-16 UNK-576 . 
 UNK-0 
 o my ! UNK-338 pie ! UNK-49 UNK-593 . he has his UNK-576 destroyed . 
 UNK-0 
 the slight UNK-688 claimed her attention but in two UNK-473 she set 
 that little matter to rights . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-52 UNK-42 a UNK-471 UNK-691 and gave a nervous UNK-766 and UNK-138 
 asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was 
 flying but she was ever UNK-872 in her UNK-270 so she simply passed 
 it off with UNK-658 UNK-159 by saying that that was the UNK-806 
 because just then the bell UNK-459 out from the UNK-358 over the quiet 
 UNK-596 because canon UNK-154 was up on the UNK-92 with the UNK-296 that 
 father UNK-190 put round his UNK-61 giving the UNK-806 with the 
 blessed UNK-511 in his hands . 
 UNK-0 
 how moving the scene there in the gathering UNK-391 the last UNK-332 
 of UNK-385 the UNK-358 UNK-44 of those evening UNK-215 and at the same 
 time a bat UNK-230 forth from the UNK-937 UNK-729 through the UNK-322 UNK-763 
 UNK-467 with a tiny lost cry . and she could see far away the lights of 
 the UNK-574 so UNK-377 she would have loved to do with a box of 
 UNK-546 because it was easier than to make a man and soon the UNK-205 
 would be going his rounds past the UNK-159 church grounds and along 
 by UNK-581 UNK-874 avenue where the couples walked and lighting the 
 lamp near her window where UNK-100 UNK-870 used to turn his UNK-683 like 
 she read in that book the UNK-205 by miss UNK-489 author of 
 UNK-80 UNK-563 and other tales . for UNK-52 had her dreams that UNK-159 
 knew of . she loved to read poetry and when she got a UNK-977 from 
 UNK-619 UNK-823 of that lovely UNK-343 album with the UNK-453 cover 
 to write her thoughts in she laid it in the UNK-877 of her UNK-105 
 which though it did not UNK-788 on the side of luxury was UNK-19 
 UNK-522 and clean . it was there she kept her UNK-175 treasure UNK-306 the 
 UNK-984 UNK-556 her child of mary badge the UNK-83 UNK-111 the 
 UNK-510 her UNK-181 UNK-872 and the UNK-978 to change 
 when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful 
 thoughts written in it in UNK-339 ink that she bought in UNK-923 of dame 
 street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only 
 express herself like that poem that UNK-177 to her so deeply that 
 she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the 
 UNK-542 . art thou real my ideal ? it was called by louis j UNK-429 
 UNK-54 and after there was something about UNK-391 UNK-611 thou 
 ever ? and UNK-103 the beauty of poetry so sad in its UNK-402 
 UNK-912 had UNK-815 her eyes with silent tears for she felt that 
 the years were UNK-851 by for her one by one and but for that one 
 UNK-732 she knew she need fear no competition and that was an 
 accident coming down UNK-54 hill and she always tried to UNK-693 it . 
 but it must end she felt . if she saw that magic UNK-38 in his eyes there 
 would be no holding back for her . love UNK-291 at UNK-232 . she 
 would make the great sacrifice . her every effort would be to share his 
 thoughts . UNK-462 than the whole world would she be to him and UNK-646 his 
 days with happiness . there was the UNK-307 question and she was 
 dying to know was he a married man or a UNK-283 who had lost his wife 
 or some tragedy like the UNK-135 with the foreign name from the land 
 of song had to have her put into a UNK-431 UNK-165 only to be kind . 
 but even UNK-829 then ? would it make a very great difference ? from 
 everything in the least UNK-774 her UNK-304 nature UNK-186 
 UNK-249 . she UNK-870 that sort of person the fallen women off the 
 accommodation walk beside the UNK-269 that went with the soldiers and 
 UNK-997 men with no respect for a girls UNK-88 UNK-797 the sex and 
 being taken up to the police station . no no not that . they would be 
 just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other 
 in UNK-300 of the conventions of society with a big UNK-689 . perhaps it was 
 an old flame he was in UNK-210 for from the days beyond recall . she 
 thought she understood . she would try to understand him because men were 
 so different . the old love was waiting waiting with little white 
 hands UNK-269 out with blue UNK-662 eyes . heart of mine ! she would 
 follow her dream of love the UNK-490 of her heart that told her he 
 was her all in all the only man in all the world for her for love was 
 the master guide . nothing else UNK-804 . come what might she would be 
 wild UNK-66 free . 
 UNK-0 
 canon UNK-154 put the blessed UNK-511 back into the UNK-601 and 
 UNK-406 and the choir UNK-57 UNK-312 UNK-311 UNK-73 UNK-755 and then 
 he locked the UNK-601 door because the UNK-806 was over and 
 father UNK-190 handed him his hat to put on and UNK-416 UNK-138 asked UNK-69 
 she coming but UNK-335 UNK-94 called out 
 UNK-0 
 o look UNK-39 ! 
 UNK-0 
 and they all looked was it sheet lightning but tommy saw it too over the 
 trees beside the church blue and then green and purple . 
 UNK-0 
 its UNK-525 UNK-39 UNK-94 said . 
 UNK-0 
 and they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church 
 UNK-732 UNK-138 with the UNK-493 with baby UNK-239 in it and UNK-39 
 holding tommy and UNK-335 by the hand so they UNK-9 fall running . 
 UNK-0 
 come on UNK-52 UNK-39 called . its the UNK-315 UNK-525 . 
 UNK-0 
 but UNK-52 was UNK-257 . she had no intention of being at their UNK-130 and 
 call . if they could run like UNK-718 she could sit so she said she could 
 see from where she was . the eyes that were UNK-21 upon her set her 
 UNK-18 UNK-567 . she looked at him a moment meeting his glance and 
 a light broke in upon her . UNK-651 passion was in that face passion 
 silent as the grave and it had made her his . at last they were left 
 alone without the others to UNK-31 and pass remarks and she knew he could 
 be trusted to the death UNK-968 a sterling man a man of UNK-639 
 UNK-88 to his UNK-455 . his hands and face were working and a UNK-106 
 went over her . she UNK-122 back far to look up where the UNK-525 were 
 and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up 
 and there was UNK-159 to see only him and her when she revealed all her 
 UNK-231 beautifully shaped legs like that supply soft and UNK-386 
 UNK-630 and she seemed to hear the UNK-572 of his heart his UNK-445 
 breathing because she knew too about the passion of men like that 
 UNK-172 because UNK-619 UNK-823 told her once in dead secret and made 
 her UNK-425 shed never about the gentleman UNK-496 that was staying with 
 them out of the UNK-628 districts board that had pictures cut out of 
 papers of those UNK-27 and UNK-833 and she said he used to do 
 something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed . but 
 this was UNK-537 different from a thing like that because there was 
 all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to 
 his and the first quick hot touch of his UNK-218 lips . besides there 
 was UNK-344 so long as you UNK-3 do the other thing before being 
 married and there ought to be women UNK-73 that would understand 
 without your telling out and UNK-39 UNK-94 too sometimes had that UNK-763 
 kind of UNK-763 look in her eyes so that she too my dear and UNK-189 
 UNK-365 so mad about actors photographs and besides it was on 
 account of that other thing coming on the way it did . 
 UNK-0 
 and UNK-335 UNK-94 UNK-247 to look there was another and she UNK-122 back 
 and the UNK-900 were blue to match on account of the transparent and 
 they all saw it and they all UNK-247 to look look there it was and 
 she UNK-122 back ever so far to see the UNK-525 and something UNK-81 was 
 flying through the air a soft thing to and UNK-161 dark . and she saw a 
 long roman candle going up over the trees up up and in the UNK-134 
 UNK-218 they were all UNK-21 with excitement as it went higher and 
 higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it high 
 high almost out of sight and her face was UNK-197 with a divine an 
 UNK-684 UNK-801 from UNK-50 back and he could see her other things 
 too UNK-952 UNK-44 the fabric that UNK-870 the skin better than 
 those other UNK-238 the green four and eleven on account of being 
 white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high 
 it went out of sight a moment and she was UNK-178 in every UNK-987 from 
 being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee 
 where UNK-159 ever not even on the swing or UNK-850 and she UNK-69 UNK-252 
 and he UNK-69 either to look in that UNK-462 way like that because he 
 UNK-18 resist the sight of the UNK-810 UNK-88 half offered like 
 those UNK-27 UNK-519 so UNK-462 before UNK-32 looking and he 
 kept on looking looking . she would UNK-140 have UNK-5 to him UNK-619 
 held out her UNK-11 UNK-293 arms to him to come to feel his lips laid on 
 her white UNK-195 the cry of a young girls love a little UNK-648 cry 
 UNK-645 from her that cry that has UNK-817 through the ages . and then a 
 rocket UNK-418 and bang shot blind blank and o ! then the roman candle 
 burst and it was like a UNK-317 of o ! and everyone UNK-5 o ! o ! in UNK-742 
 and it UNK-258 out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they 
 shed and ah ! they were all UNK-656 UNK-934 stars falling with golden o so 
 lovely o soft sweet soft ! 
 UNK-0 
 then all UNK-49 away UNK-768 in the grey air all was silent . ah ! she 
 UNK-75 at him as she bent forward quickly a UNK-688 little glance of 
 UNK-660 protest of UNK-523 UNK-91 under which he UNK-332 like a girl he 
 was UNK-200 back against the rock behind . UNK-27 bloom for it is he 
 stands silent with UNK-170 head before those young UNK-759 eyes . what a 
 UNK-64 he had been ! at it again ? a fair UNK-176 soul had called to him 
 and UNK-208 that he was how had he answered ? an UNK-916 cad he had been ! 
 he of all men ! but there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes 
 for him too a word of UNK-906 even though he had UNK-640 and UNK-251 and 
 UNK-326 . should a girl tell ? no a thousand times no . that was their 
 secret only UNK-75 alone in the UNK-8 UNK-391 and there was none to 
 know or tell save the little bat that UNK-230 so UNK-41 through the evening 
 to and UNK-161 and little UNK-430 dont tell . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-39 UNK-94 UNK-250 UNK-311 the boys in the football field to show 
 what a great person she was and then she UNK-5 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-52 ! UNK-52 ! were going . come on . we can see from UNK-199 up . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-52 had an idea one of loves little UNK-288 . she UNK-728 a hand into 
 her UNK-5 pocket and took out the UNK-350 and UNK-234 in reply of 
 course without letting him and then UNK-728 it back . wonder if UNK-2 too 
 far to . she rose . was it UNK-244 ? no . she had to go but they would meet 
 again there and she would dream of that till then tomorrow of her 
 dream of UNK-121 eve . she drew herself up to her full height . their souls 
 met in a last UNK-410 glance and the eyes that reached her heart full 
 of a strange UNK-160 hung UNK-743 on her sweet UNK-740 face . she 
 half UNK-24 at him UNK-302 a sweet UNK-25 smile a smile that UNK-93 
 on tears and then they UNK-621 . 
 UNK-0 
 slowly without looking back she went down the UNK-512 strand to UNK-39 
 to UNK-138 to UNK-335 and tommy UNK-94 to little baby UNK-239 . it was 
 UNK-13 now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and 
 UNK-263 UNK-638 . she walked with a certain quiet UNK-491 characteristic 
 of her but with care and very slowly UNK-606 UNK-52 UNK-498 
 was . . . 
 UNK-0 
 tight boots ? no . UNK-23 UNK-201 ! o !

 you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped . 
 yet if i went the whole UNK-981 say i want to something like that . 
 because i did . she too . UNK-878 her . then make it up . UNK-883 to want 
 something UNK-229 then cry off for her sake . UNK-659 them . she must 
 have been thinking of someone else all the time . what harm ? must since 
 she came to the use of reason he he and he . first kiss does the trick . 
 the UNK-660 moment . something inside them goes pop . UNK-249 like tell 
 by their eye on the UNK-147 . first thoughts are best . remember that till 
 their dying day . UNK-36 UNK-731 UNK-845 that UNK-166 her under the 
 UNK-769 wall beside the gardens . fifteen she told me . but her breasts 
 were developed . fell UNK-314 then . after UNK-355 dinner that was when we 
 drove home . UNK-313 mountain . UNK-3 her teeth in sleep . lord mayor 
 had his eye on her too . val UNK-231 . UNK-563 . 
 UNK-0 
 there she is with them down there for the UNK-525 . my UNK-525 . up 
 like a rocket down like a stick . and the children twins they must 
 be waiting for something to happen . want to be UNK-183 . dressing in 
 mothers clothes . time enough understand all the ways of the world . and 
 the dark one with the UNK-71 head and the UNK-848 mouth . i knew she could 
 UNK-266 . mouth made for that . like UNK-36 . why that UNK-440 whore in 
 UNK-36 UNK-71 her UNK-296 only to her nose . would you mind please telling 
 me the right time ? ill tell you the right time up a dark lane . 
 say UNK-927 and UNK-952 forty times every morning cure for fat lips . 
 UNK-539 the little boy too . UNK-441 see most of the game . of course 
 they understand birds animals babies . in their line . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-3 look back when she was going down the strand . UNK-9 give that 
 satisfaction . those girls those girls those lovely UNK-652 girls . fine 
 eyes she had clear . its the white of the eye brings that out not so 
 much the UNK-846 . did she know what i ? course . like a cat sitting beyond 
 a dogs jump . women never meet one like that UNK-772 in the high school 
 drawing a picture of UNK-447 with all his UNK-723 on show . call that 
 UNK-636 ? poor UNK-818 ! his wife has her work cut out for her . never see 
 them sit on a bench marked wet paint . eyes all over them . look under 
 the bed for whats not there . UNK-868 to get the UNK-512 of their lives . 
 sharp as UNK-486 they are . when i said to UNK-36 the man at the corner of 
 UNK-624 street was UNK-286 thought she might like UNK-957 at once he 
 had a false arm . had too . where do they get that ? UNK-804 going up roger 
 UNK-935 UNK-93 two at a time to show her UNK-750 . handed down 
 from father to mother to daughter i mean . UNK-338 in the bone . UNK-127 for 
 example UNK-980 her UNK-185 on the mirror to save the UNK-501 . best 
 place for an ad to catch a UNK-95 eye on a mirror . and when i sent 
 her for UNK-573 UNK-517 UNK-975 to UNK-520 by the way that ad i must 
 carrying home the change in her UNK-261 ! UNK-324 little UNK-125 . i never 
 told her . UNK-522 way she carries UNK-879 too . attract men small thing 
 like that . holding up her hand UNK-144 it to let the blood flow back 
 when it was red . who did you learn that from ? nobody . something the 
 nurse taught me . o dont they know ! three years old she was in front of 
 UNK-573 UNK-665 just before we left UNK-860 street west . me have 
 a nice pace . UNK-812 . who knows ? ways of the world . young student . 
 straight on her pins anyway not like the other . still she was game . 
 lord i am wet . devil you are . UNK-696 of her UNK-992 . transparent stockings 
 UNK-269 to breaking point . not like that UNK-236 today . a . e . UNK-558 
 stockings . or the one in UNK-804 street . white . wow ! beef to the heel . 
 UNK-0 
 a monkey puzzle rocket burst UNK-413 in UNK-135 UNK-586 . UNK-240 and 
 UNK-240 zrads UNK-240 . and UNK-39 and tommy and UNK-335 ran out to see and 
 UNK-138 after with the UNK-493 and then UNK-52 beyond the curve of the rocks . 
 will she ? watch ! watch ! see ! looked round . she UNK-616 an onion . UNK-285 
 i saw your . i saw all . 
 UNK-0 
 lord ! 
 UNK-0 
 did me good all the same . off colour after UNK-149 UNK-707 . for 
 this relief much thanks . in UNK-107 that is . lord ! it was all things 
 combined . excitement . when she UNK-122 back felt an UNK-223 at the butt 
 of my tongue . your head it simply UNK-843 . UNK-2 right . might have made a 
 worse fool of myself however . instead of talking about nothing . then 
 i will tell you all . still it was a kind of language between us . it 
 UNK-18 be ? no UNK-52 they called her . might be false name however like 
 my name and the address UNK-7 barn a blind . 
 UNK-0 
 her maiden name was UNK-363 brown and she lived with her mother in 
 UNK-736 . 
 UNK-0 
 place made me think of that i suppose . all UNK-393 with the same brush 
 UNK-859 pens in their stockings . but the ball rolled down to her as if 
 it understood . every bullet has its UNK-359 . course i never could throw 
 anything straight at school . UNK-529 as a UNK-475 horn . sad however 
 because it UNK-360 only a few years till they settle down to UNK-412 
 and UNK-490 pants will soon fit UNK-766 and UNK-137 earth for the baby 
 when they hold him out to do ah ah . no soft job . saves them . keeps 
 them out of UNK-516 way . nature . washing child washing UNK-341 . UNK-28 . 
 childrens hands always round them . UNK-594 UNK-709 UNK-626 not even 
 closed at first UNK-878 milk in their UNK-703 and UNK-641 UNK-502 . UNK-169 
 to have given that child an empty UNK-883 to suck . fill it up with wind . 
 mrs UNK-645 UNK-342 . must call to the hospital . wonder is nurse UNK-53 
 there still . she used to look over some nights when UNK-36 was in the 
 coffee palace . that young doctor UNK-749 i noticed her UNK-751 his coat . 
 and mrs UNK-115 and mrs UNK-28 once like that too UNK-746 . worst 
 of all at night mrs UNK-333 told me in the city arms . husband rolling in 
 drunk UNK-3 of pub off him like a UNK-923 . have that in your nose in 
 the dark UNK-792 of UNK-377 UNK-118 . then ask in the morning was i drunk 
 last night ? bad policy however to fault the husband . UNK-37 come home 
 to UNK-101 . they stick by one another like UNK-42 . maybe the womens fault 
 also . thats where UNK-36 can knock spots off them . its the blood of the 
 south . UNK-769 . also the form the figure . hands felt for the UNK-593 . 
 just compare for instance those others . wife locked up at home UNK-232 
 in the UNK-899 . allow me to introduce my . then they UNK-425 you out some 
 kind of a UNK-856 UNK-9 know what to call her . always see a 
 UNK-13 weak point in his wife . still UNK-6 destiny in it falling 
 in love . have their own secrets between them . UNK-644 that would go to the 
 dogs if some woman UNK-3 take them in hand . then little UNK-101 of girls 
 height of a UNK-378 in UNK-526 with little UNK-744 . as god made them 
 he matched them . sometimes children turn out well enough . twice UNK-527 
 makes one . or old rich UNK-26 of UNK-685 and UNK-521 bride . UNK-454 in may 
 and UNK-350 in december . this wet is very UNK-144 . stuck . well the 
 UNK-23 is not back . better UNK-700 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-52 ! 
 UNK-0 
 other hand a UNK-698 with a UNK-266 up to his UNK-484 . long and 
 the short of it . big he and little she . very strange about my watch . 
 UNK-386 are always going wrong . wonder is there any magnetic 
 influence between the person because that was about the time he . yes i 
 suppose at once . cats away the mice will play . i remember looking 
 in pill lane . also that now is UNK-509 . back of everything UNK-509 . 
 earth for instance pulling this and being pulled . that causes movement . 
 and time well thats the time the movement takes . then if one thing 
 stopped the whole UNK-397 would stop bit by bit . because its all 
 arranged . magnetic needle tells you whats going on in the sun the 
 stars . little piece of steel iron . when you hold out the fork . come . 
 come . tip . woman and man that is . fork and steel . UNK-36 he . dress up 
 and look and suggest and let you see and see more and UNK-13 you if UNK-14 
 a man to see that and like a UNK-207 coming legs look look and if you 
 have any UNK-655 in you . tip . have to let fly . 
 UNK-0 
 wonder how is she feeling in that region . shame all put on before third 
 person . more put out about a hole in her UNK-261 . UNK-36 her UNK-376 
 stuck out head back about the farmer in the UNK-487 and UNK-6 at 
 the horse show . and when the UNK-598 were in UNK-860 street west . 
 fine voice that fellow had . how UNK-256 began . smell that i did . like 
 flowers . it was too . UNK-427 . came from the UNK-988 probably in the 
 paint . make their own use of everything . same time doing it UNK-634 her 
 UNK-7 on the floor so they UNK-9 hear . but lots of them cant kick 
 the beam i think . keep that thing up for hours . kind of a general all 
 round over me and half down my back . 
 UNK-0 
 wait . UNK-723 . UNK-723 . yes . thats her perfume . why she UNK-234 her hand . i leave 
 you this to think of me when im far away on the pillow . what is it ? 
 UNK-549 ? no . UNK-14 ? UNK-723 . roses i think . shed like UNK-111 of that 
 kind . sweet and cheap soon UNK-878 . why UNK-36 likes UNK-449 . suits her 
 with a little UNK-548 mixed . her high notes and her low notes . at the 
 dance night she met him dance of the hours . heat brought it out . she 
 was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before . good 
 UNK-654 is it ? or bad ? light too . suppose UNK-6 some connection . 
 for instance if you go into a UNK-401 where its dark . mysterious thing 
 too . why did i smell it only now ? took its time in coming like herself 
 slow but sure . suppose its ever so many millions of tiny UNK-947 
 UNK-944 across . yes it is . because those spice islands UNK-474 this 
 morning smell them UNK-204 off . tell you what it is . its like a fine 
 fine UNK-296 or web they have all over the skin fine like what do you 
 call it UNK-960 and UNK-30 always UNK-785 it out of them fine as 
 anything like rainbow colours without knowing it . UNK-970 to everything 
 she takes off . UNK-745 of her stockings . warm shoe . stays . UNK-440 little 
 kick taking them off . UNK-406 till next time . also the cat likes to UNK-624 
 in her shift on the bed . know her smell in a thousand . UNK-30 too . 
 UNK-137 me of UNK-466 and cream . wonder where it is really . there 
 or the UNK-672 or under the neck . because you get it out of all holes 
 and corners . UNK-14 perfume made of oil of UNK-695 or something . 
 UNK-591 . bag under their UNK-911 . one grain pour off UNK-143 for years . dogs 
 at each other behind . good evening . evening . how do you UNK-624 ? UNK-723 . UNK-723 . 
 very well thank you . animals go by that . yes now look at it that way . 
 were the same . some women instance UNK-276 you off when they have their 
 period . come near . then get a UNK-736 you could hang your hat on . like 
 what ? UNK-945 UNK-705 gone UNK-377 or . UNK-151 ! please keep off the grass . 
 UNK-0 
 perhaps they get a man smell off us . what though ? UNK-699 gloves long 
 john had on his desk the other day . breath ? what you eat and drink gives 
 that . no . UNK-718 i mean . must be connected with that because UNK-73 
 that are supposed to be are different . women buzz round it like UNK-714 
 round UNK-78 . UNK-825 off the UNK-92 get on to it at any cost . the tree 
 of forbidden priest . o father will you ? let me be the first to . that 
 UNK-756 itself all through the body UNK-909 . source of life . and 
 its extremely curious the smell . UNK-461 sauce . let me . 
 UNK-0 
 mr bloom inserted his nose . UNK-723 . into the . UNK-723 . opening of his UNK-187 . 
 UNK-657 or . no . UNK-667 it is . ah no thats the soap . 
 UNK-0 
 o by the by that UNK-596 . i knew there was something on my mind . never 
 went back and the soap not paid . UNK-279 carrying bottles like that UNK-996 
 this morning . UNK-45 might have paid me that three UNK-51 . i could 
 mention UNK-643 just to remind him . still if he works that paragraph . 
 two and nine . bad opinion of me hell have . call tomorrow . how much do 
 i UNK-641 you ? three and nine ? two and nine sir . ah . might stop him giving 
 credit another time . lose your customers that way . pubs do . UNK-13 run 
 up a bill on the UNK-283 and then UNK-869 around the back streets into 
 somewhere else . 
 UNK-0

 a mile . sure he has a small bank balance somewhere government sit . walk 
 after him now make him UNK-795 like those UNK-241 me today . still you 
 learn something . see ourselves as others see us . so long as women dont 
 UNK-896 what matter ? thats the way to find out . ask yourself who is he 
 now . the mystery man on the beach prize UNK-315 story by mr UNK-27 
 bloom . payment at the rate of one guinea per column . and that fellow 
 today at the UNK-759 in the brown macintosh . UNK-710 on his UNK-104 
 however . healthy perhaps UNK-339 all the . UNK-266 brings rain they say . 
 must be some somewhere . salt in the UNK-421 UNK-261 . the body feels the 
 atmosphere . old UNK-667 UNK-723 are on the rack . mother UNK-634 
 UNK-195 that is about ships around they fly in the UNK-564 . no . signs 
 of rain it is . the royal reader . and distant hills seem coming UNK-138 .

 under them . but its the evening influence . they feel all that . open 
 like flowers know their hours UNK-383 jerusalem UNK-857 in 
 UNK-910 UNK-949 UNK-18 under the lamps . UNK-261 in mat 
 UNK-661 garden where i UNK-166 her shoulder . wish i had a full length

 so blind . have birds no smell ? UNK-65 . they believed you could 
 be changed into a tree from UNK-383 . UNK-984 willow . ba . there he goes . 
 funny little UNK-806 . wonder where he lives . UNK-729 up there . very 
 likely . hanging by his UNK-183 in the UNK-143 of UNK-225 . bell scared him

 valuation when i was in UNK-168 . UNK-437 it is . two houses they have . 
 gabriel UNK-891 brother is UNK-114 . ba . again . wonder why they come out 
 at night like mice . UNK-30 a mixed breed . birds are like UNK-827 mice . 
 what UNK-631 them light or noise ? better sit still . all UNK-375 
 like the bird in UNK-520 got water out of the end of a jar by throwing 
 in UNK-529 . like a little man in a UNK-382 he is with tiny hands . UNK-727 
 bones . almost see them UNK-459 kind of a UNK-503 white . colours depend 
 on the light you see . UNK-855 the sun for example like the eagle then look 
 at a shoe see a UNK-883 UNK-715 UNK-487 . wants to stamp his trademark on 
 everything . instance that cat this morning on the UNK-116 . colour of 
 brown UNK-474 . say you never see them with three colours . not true . that 
 half UNK-301 UNK-984 in the city arms with the letter em on 
 her UNK-133 . body fifty different colours . UNK-301 a while ago UNK-199 . 
 glass flashing . thats how that wise man whats his name with the 
 burning glass . then the heather goes on fire . it cant be UNK-620 
 matches . what ? perhaps the sticks dry UNK-936 together in the wind and 
 light . or broken bottles in the UNK-652 act as a burning glass in the sun . 
 UNK-433 . i have it ! my UNK-947 not so bad . 
 UNK-0 
 ba . who knows what UNK-30 always flying for . insects ? that bee last 
 week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling . might 
 be the one bit me come back to see . birds too . never find out . or what 
 they say . like our small talk . and says she and says he . nerve they have 
 to fly over the ocean and back . lots must be killed in UNK-288 UNK-323 
 wires . UNK-348 life UNK-2 have too . big UNK-948 of UNK-497 UNK-232 
 UNK-621 along in the dark UNK-147 out like UNK-124 . UNK-502 a 
 UNK-463 ! out of that bloody UNK-217 to you ! others in vessels bit of 
 a UNK-185 sail UNK-199 about like UNK-68 at a wake when the UNK-480 
 winds do blow . married too . sometimes away for years at the ends of the 
 earth somewhere . no ends really because its round . wife in every port 
 they say . she has a good job if she minds it till johnny comes UNK-289 
 home again . if ever he does . UNK-749 the tail end of ports . how can 
 they like the sea ? yet they do . the UNK-109 UNK-441 . off he UNK-85 with 
 a UNK-141 or a medal on him for luck . well . and the UNK-616 no whats 
 this they call it poor UNK-490 father had on his door to touch . that 
 brought us out of the land of egypt and into the house of bondage . 
 something in all those UNK-677 because when you go out never know 
 what UNK-519 . hanging on to a UNK-849 or UNK-439 of a beam for UNK-771 life 
 UNK-796 round him UNK-866 salt water and thats the last of his UNK-388 
 till the UNK-974 catch hold of him . do fish ever get UNK-125 ? 
 UNK-0

 crew and cargo in UNK-120 UNK-188 jones UNK-999 moon looking down so

 UNK-180 that persons UNK-945 is UNK-38 very little UNK-705 
 concerning UNK-303 matters are being held as most UNK-471 by 
 UNK-919 with UNK-114 UNK-771 to be studied who is UNK-814 of that 
 which the most in doctrine UNK-910 and certainly by reason of that in 
 them high minds UNK-677 UNK-603 of UNK-296 constantly maintain 
 when by general consent they UNK-467 that other circumstances being 
 equal by no exterior UNK-69 is the UNK-532 of a nation more 
 UNK-275 UNK-398 than by the measure of how far forward may 
 have UNK-40 the tribute of its UNK-890 for that UNK-901 
 UNK-960 which of UNK-473 the original if it be absent when UNK-347 
 present constitutes the certain sign of UNK-620 UNK-978 UNK-626 
 UNK-916 . for who is there who anything of some significance has 
 UNK-943 but is conscious that that exterior UNK-69 may be the 
 surface of a UNK-918 UNK-115 reality or on the contrary anyone 
 so is there UNK-679 as not to UNK-680 that as no UNK-978 UNK-263 
 can UNK-164 against the UNK-161 of increase so it UNK-586 every most just 
 citizen to become the UNK-726 and UNK-441 of his UNK-754 and 
 to UNK-498 UNK-689 what had in the past been by the nation UNK-742 
 UNK-304 might be in the future not with similar excellence 
 accomplished if an UNK-862 UNK-158 shall have gradually UNK-674 
 the UNK-176 by UNK-309 transmitted customs to that UNK-467 of 
 UNK-534 that that one was UNK-925 UNK-456 who would have the 
 UNK-464 to rise UNK-950 that no more UNK-878 UNK-0 can for anyone

 function ever UNK-196 UNK-980 ? 
 UNK-0 
 it is not why therefore we shall wonder if as the best UNK-709 
 relate among the UNK-832 who nothing that was not in its nature 
 UNK-976 UNK-336 the art of medicine shall have been highly UNK-1 . 
 not to speak of hostels UNK-128 UNK-276 chambers UNK-431 
 their greatest doctors the UNK-855 the UNK-711 the UNK-798 
 have UNK-418 set down the UNK-8 methods by which the sick and the 
 UNK-587 found again health whether the UNK-726 had been the UNK-178 
 UNK-809 or loose UNK-535 flux . certainly in every public work which 
 in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with importance 
 UNK-975 and therefore a plan was by them adopted whether by having 
 UNK-70 or as the UNK-146 of experience it is difficult in 
 being said which the UNK-132 opinions of subsequent UNK-64 are not 
 up to the present UNK-859 to render UNK-524 UNK-217 maternity was so 
 far from all accident possibility removed that whatever care the patient 
 in that all UNK-477 of woman hour UNK-430 required and not solely 
 for the UNK-714 UNK-593 but also for her who not being sufficiently 
 UNK-662 UNK-253 and often not even UNK-253 could UNK-766 UNK-360 and 
 for an UNK-763 UNK-405 was provided .

 to her nothing already then and UNK-986 was anyway able to be

 being seen but also even in being related worthy of being UNK-14 that 
 they her by UNK-591 went seeing mother that she by them suddenly

 now done and by wise UNK-475 set but to this no less of what drugs 
 there is need and surgical UNK-895 which are UNK-511 to her 
 case not UNK-952 aspect of all very UNK-518 UNK-815 in various 
 UNK-332 by our UNK-415 UNK-775 offered together with images divine 
 and human the UNK-117 of which by UNK-923 females is to UNK-820

 mothers when UNK-752 far gone and UNK-635 it is come by her 
 UNK-1 to lie in her term up . 
 UNK-0 
 some man that UNK-987 was stood by UNK-32 at nights UNK-617 . of

 UNK-879 ward . 
 UNK-0 
 in ward UNK-279 the UNK-398 hearing come that man UNK-143 UNK-646 rising 
 with UNK-743 UNK-442 to him her gate wide UNK-939 . lo UNK-197 UNK-410 
 UNK-664 in UNK-474 UNK-192 UNK-501 UNK-312 . full she UNK-470 that 
 god the UNK-570 all UNK-205 would UNK-306 with water for his evil UNK-104 . 
 UNK-244 UNK-289 made she on UNK-444 and him drew that he would UNK-689 
 UNK-17 under her UNK-490 . that man her will UNK-783 UNK-581 went in 
 UNK-81 house . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-426 to UNK-654 in UNK-81 hall hat holding the seeker stood . on her UNK-343 he 
 UNK-971 was living with dear wife and UNK-242 daughter that then over land 
 and UNK-761 nine years had long UNK-953 . once her in UNK-835 
 meeting he to her bow had not UNK-778 . her to UNK-540 now he UNK-180 with 
 good ground of her allowed that that of him UNK-960 face UNK-349 so 
 young then had looked . light swift her eyes UNK-537 bloom of UNK-136 
 his word winning . 
 UNK-0 
 as her eyes then UNK-241 his UNK-861 UNK-646 UNK-633 UNK-234 she UNK-60 . glad 
 after she was that UNK-971 UNK-107 was . her he asked if UNK-749 doctor UNK-500 
 sent from far coast and she with UNK-368 UNK-317 him answered that UNK-749 
 doctor in heaven was . sad was the man that word to hear that him so 
 UNK-780 in UNK-676 UNK-303 . all she there told him UNK-141 death for 
 friend so young UNK-324 UNK-713 UNK-47 gods UNK-978 to UNK-769 . 
 she said that he had a fair sweet death through god his UNK-403 with 
 UNK-911 to be UNK-726 holy UNK-703 and sick mens oil to his UNK-477 . 
 the man then right UNK-477 asked the UNK-642 of which death the dead man was 
 died and the UNK-642 answered him and said that he was died in UNK-236 island 
 through UNK-215 three year UNK-556 come UNK-846 and she UNK-124 to god 
 the UNK-282 to have his dear soul in his UNK-818 . he heard her 
 sad words in held hat sad UNK-151 . so stood they there both UNK-401 in 
 UNK-539 UNK-623 one with other . 
 UNK-0 
 therefore UNK-605 look to that last end that is thy death and the 
 dust that UNK-58 on every man that is born of woman for as he came 
 naked forth from his mothers UNK-656 so naked shall he UNK-708 him at the 
 last for to go as he came . 
 UNK-0 
 the man that was come in to the house then spoke to the UNK-714 and 
 he asked her how it UNK-560 with the woman that lay there in UNK-653 . 
 the UNK-714 answered him and said that that woman was in UNK-108 
 now full three days and that it would be a hard birth UNK-420 to bear 
 but that now in a little it would be . she said UNK-1 that she had 
 seen many UNK-937 of women but never was none so hard as was that UNK-95 
 birth . then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man 
 that time was had lived UNK-138 that house . the man UNK-294 to her words 
 for he felt with wonder womens UNK-726 in the UNK-614 that they have of 
 UNK-158 and he UNK-105 to look on her face that was a fair face for 
 any man to see but yet was she left after long years a UNK-330 . nine 
 twelve UNK-404 UNK-834 her UNK-236 . 
 UNK-0 
 and UNK-975 they UNK-82 the door of the castle was opened and there UNK-732 
 them a UNK-151 noise as of many that sat there at meat . and there came 
 against the place as they stood a young UNK-393 UNK-910 UNK-110 . and 
 the traveller UNK-27 was UNK-16 to him UNK-607 it had UNK-918 that they 
 had had UNK-634 each with other in the house of UNK-94 where this 
 UNK-393 lay by cause the traveller UNK-27 came there to be 
 UNK-985 for he was UNK-713 UNK-110 in his breast by a UNK-99 UNK-30 a 
 horrible and UNK-348 dragon was UNK-102 him for which he did do make 
 a UNK-943 of UNK-252 salt and UNK-130 as much as he might UNK-207 . and he 
 said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with 
 them that were there . and the traveller UNK-27 said that he should go 
 UNK-324 for he was a man of UNK-325 and a UNK-942 . also the lady 
 was of his UNK-772 and UNK-521 the UNK-393 though she UNK-666 well 
 that the traveller had said thing that was false for his UNK-586 . but 
 the UNK-393 would not hear say UNK-376 nor do her UNK-541 ne have 
 him in UNK-461 UNK-806 to his list and he said how it was a UNK-902 
 castle . and the traveller UNK-27 went into the castle for to rest him 
 for a space being UNK-713 of UNK-987 after many UNK-89 UNK-798 in UNK-8 
 lands and UNK-121 UNK-370 . 
 UNK-0 
 and in the castle was set a board that was of the UNK-283 of UNK-894 
 and it was UNK-165 by four UNK-539 of that country but they UNK-884 not 
 move more for UNK-555 . and on this board were UNK-728 UNK-503 and 
 knives that are made in a great UNK-340 by UNK-776 UNK-808 out of white 
 UNK-709 that they fix then in the UNK-597 of UNK-337 and UNK-63 that there 
 UNK-578 UNK-782 . and there were vessels that are UNK-853 by magic of 
 UNK-522 out of UNK-588 and the air by a UNK-548 with his breath that he 
 UNK-856 in to them like to UNK-991 . and full fair UNK-897 and rich was on 
 the board that no UNK-591 could UNK-216 a UNK-913 ne UNK-280 . and there was 
 a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange 
 UNK-253 UNK-814 heads though UNK-207 men UNK-53 that this be possible 
 thing without they see it UNK-356 they are so . and these UNK-253 lie 
 in an UNK-190 water brought there from portugal land because of the UNK-273 
 that UNK-343 is like to the UNK-398 of the UNK-755 . and also it was 
 a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a UNK-543 out of 
 UNK-785 UNK-495 out of UNK-455 that by aid of certain angry spirits 
 that they do in to it UNK-335 up UNK-7 like to a vast mountain . and 
 they teach the UNK-124 there to UNK-734 themselves up on long sticks 
 out of the ground and of the scales of these UNK-124 they UNK-228 out a 
 UNK-172 like to UNK-793 . 
 UNK-0 
 and the learning knight let pour for UNK-67 UNK-27 a UNK-643 and UNK-962 
 UNK-1 the while all they that were there UNK-59 every each . and UNK-67 
 UNK-27 did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took UNK-637 somewhat 
 in UNK-903 for he never UNK-59 no manner of UNK-793 which he then put by and 
 UNK-11 full UNK-983 he UNK-696 the more part in his UNK-379 glass and 
 his UNK-379 UNK-394 not of this UNK-219 . and he sat down in that castle with 
 them for to rest him there UNK-401 . UNK-433 be UNK-783 god .

 this meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and UNK-113 them at the 
 UNK-510 of UNK-668 our UNK-90 UNK-235 lord to leave their UNK-729 for 
 there was above one quick with child a gentle dame whose time UNK-271 
 fast . sir UNK-27 heard on the UNK-574 cry on high and he UNK-105 what 
 cry that it was whether of child or woman and i marvel said he that it 
 be not come or now . UNK-473 it UNK-839 UNK-492 . and he was ware and saw 
 a franklin that UNK-223 UNK-10 on that side the table that was older than 
 any of the UNK-467 and for that they both were knights UNK-729 in the 
 one UNK-226 and UNK-49 by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full 
 gently . but said he or it be long too she will bring forth by god his 
 UNK-161 and have joy of her UNK-258 for she UNK-718 UNK-56 UNK-902 long . 
 and the franklin that had UNK-355 said UNK-426 each moment to be her 
 next . also he took the cup that stood UNK-165 him for him needed never 
 none asking nor UNK-503 of him to drink and now drink said he fully 
 UNK-825 and he UNK-477 as far as he might to their UNK-3 health for 
 he was a passing good man of his UNK-543 . and sir UNK-27 that was the 
 UNK-22 guest that ever sat in scholars hall and that was the UNK-88 
 man and the UNK-168 that ever laid UNK-146 hand under UNK-216 and that was 
 the very UNK-591 knight of the world one that ever did UNK-881 service 
 to lady gentle UNK-724 him UNK-997 in the cup . UNK-95 UNK-726 with wonder 
 UNK-960 . 
 UNK-0 
 now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be 
 UNK-355 an they might . there was a sort of scholars along either side 
 the board that is to wit UNK-110 UNK-910 junior of saint mary UNK-128 
 with other his UNK-13 UNK-15 and UNK-501 scholars of medicine and the 
 franklin that UNK-223 UNK-10 and one from UNK-401 UNK-114 one UNK-877 and 
 young stephen that had UNK-855 of a UNK-495 that was at head of the board 
 and UNK-509 that men UNK-372 punch UNK-509 all long of a UNK-231 of 
 him UNK-330 UNK-173 and of all them reserved young stephen he was the 
 most UNK-355 that UNK-306 still of more UNK-793 and beside the UNK-965 sir 
 UNK-27 . but on young UNK-226 they UNK-56 for that he promised to have 
 come and such as intended to no UNK-403 said how he had broke his UNK-280 . 
 and sir UNK-27 sat with them for he UNK-135 fast friendship to sir simon 
 and to this his son young stephen and for that his UNK-389 UNK-106 him 
 there after longest UNK-884 UNK-811 as they UNK-515 him for that 
 time in the UNK-201 manner . ruth red him love led on with will to 
 UNK-588 UNK-426 to leave . 
 UNK-0 
 for they were right UNK-130 scholars . and he heard their UNK-485 each gen 
 other as UNK-358 birth and UNK-959 young UNK-501 maintaining that 
 put such case it were hard the wife to die for so it had fallen out a 
 matter of some year UNK-556 with a woman of UNK-724 in UNK-81 house that 
 now was UNK-617 out of this world and the self night next before her 
 death all UNK-912 and UNK-386 had taken counsel of her case . and 
 they said UNK-199 she should live because in the beginning they said 
 the woman should bring forth in pain and UNK-977 they that were of 
 this imagination UNK-559 how young UNK-501 had said truth for he had 
 UNK-212 to let her die . and not few and of these was young UNK-15 
 were in doubt that the world was now right evil UNK-397 as it was never 
 other UNK-239 the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his 
 judges did provide no remedy . a UNK-251 god grant . this was UNK-231 said 
 but all UNK-5 with one UNK-931 UNK-376 by our virgin mother the wife 
 should live and the babe to die . in colour UNK-958 they UNK-22 hot 
 upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the 
 franklin UNK-10 was prompt each when to pour them UNK-556 so that at the 
 least way UNK-899 might not lack . then young UNK-501 showed all the whole 
 affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by 
 UNK-909 of palmer and UNK-297 and for a UNK-380 he had made to saint UNK-465 of 
 UNK-430 her UNK-39 husband would not let her death UNK-217 they were 
 all UNK-810 UNK-619 . to whom young stephen had these words following 
 UNK-208 UNK-79 is UNK-49 UNK-226 among lay folk . both babe and parent now 
 UNK-208 their maker the one in UNK-487 UNK-286 the other in UNK-91 . 
 but UNK-622 what of those UNK-173 souls that we UNK-803 
 UNK-617 which is the sin against the holy ghost very god lord 
 and UNK-599 of life ? for UNK-79 he said our UNK-431 is brief . we are means 
 to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we . 
 then said UNK-110 junior to punch UNK-509 UNK-297 he what ends . but he had 
 UNK-444 UNK-355 and the best word he could have of him was that he 
 would ever UNK-985 a woman UNK-286 she were or wife or UNK-685 or UNK-582 if 
 it so UNK-987 him to be delivered of his UNK-716 of UNK-226 . UNK-91 
 UNK-877 of UNK-401 UNK-114 UNK-57 young UNK-240 praise of that beast the 
 UNK-129 how once in the millennium he UNK-298 by his horn the other all 
 this while UNK-202 forward with their UNK-647 UNK-30 they did UNK-953 
 him UNK-704 all and several by saint UNK-749 his engines that 
 he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do . UNK-241 
 UNK-20 they all right UNK-133 only young stephen and sir UNK-27 which 
 never UNK-884 laugh too open by reason of a strange UNK-179 which he would 
 not UNK-196 and also for that he UNK-797 for her that bare UNK-286 she might 
 be or UNK-203 . then UNK-82 young stephen UNK-391 of mother church 
 that would cast him out of her UNK-186 of law of UNK-393 of UNK-888 
 UNK-186 of UNK-399 of UNK-815 UNK-853 by wind of seeds of UNK-831 
 or by UNK-190 of UNK-39 mouth to mouth or as UNK-670 UNK-322 by the 
 influence of the UNK-495 or by the UNK-155 of UNK-217 or an she lie 
 with a woman which her man has but UNK-89 with UNK-197 UNK-65 or 
 UNK-670 in her bath according to the opinions of UNK-281 and moses 
 UNK-666 . he said also how at the end of the second month a human soul 
 was UNK-591 and how in all our holy mother UNK-832 ever souls for gods 
 greater glory whereas that UNK-392 mother which was but a dam to bear 
 UNK-881 should die by canon for so UNK-322 he that UNK-676 the UNK-394 
 seal even that blessed peter on which rock was holy church for all ages 
 founded . all they UNK-816 then asked of sir UNK-27 would he in like 
 case so UNK-633 her person as risk life to save life . a UNK-104 of 
 mind he would answer as fitted all and UNK-889 hand to UNK-110 he said 
 UNK-6 as his UNK-19 was that as it was informed him who had ever 
 loved the art of UNK-158 as might a UNK-776 and UNK-971 also with his 
 experience of so UNK-12 an accident it was good for that mother 
 church UNK-481 at one blow had birth and death UNK-443 and in such sort 
 UNK-913 he UNK-196 their questions . that is truth UNK-487 said UNK-110 
 and or i UNK-788 a pregnant word . which hearing young stephen was a 
 UNK-902 glad man and he UNK-349 that he who UNK-410 from the poor 
 UNK-931 to the lord for he was of a wild manner when he was UNK-355 and 
 that he was now in that taking it appeared UNK-741 . 
 UNK-0 
 but sir UNK-27 was passing grave UNK-498 his word by cause he still had 
 UNK-47 of the UNK-826 UNK-527 of UNK-367 women in their labour 
 and as he was UNK-764 of his good lady marion that had UNK-618 him an only 
 UNK-268 which on his UNK-28 day on live had died and no man of art 
 could save so dark is destiny . and she was UNK-810 UNK-932 of heart 
 for that evil UNK-68 and for his UNK-998 did him on a fair UNK-783 of 
 UNK-834 wool the flower of the UNK-275 UNK-689 he might UNK-878 UNK-944 and 
 lie UNK-449 for it was then about the UNK-619 of the winter and now sir 
 UNK-27 that had of his body no UNK-268 for an UNK-759 looked upon him his 
 friends son and was shut up in UNK-234 for his UNK-768 happiness and 
 as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage for all 
 UNK-646 him of real parts so UNK-619 he also in no less measure 
 for young stephen for that he lived UNK-658 with those UNK-580 and 
 UNK-353 his goods with UNK-264 . 
 UNK-0 
 about that present time young stephen filled all cups that stood empty 
 so as there remained but little mo if the UNK-391 had not UNK-932 
 their approach from him that still UNK-183 it very UNK-796 who UNK-725 for 
 the UNK-310 of the UNK-480 UNK-322 he gave them for a pledge the 
 UNK-7 of christ which also as he said is UNK-7 of UNK-841 . now drink we 
 UNK-711 he of this UNK-77 and UNK-987 ye this UNK-793 which is not indeed parcel 
 of my body but my souls UNK-78 . leave ye fraction of bread to them 
 that live by bread alone . be not UNK-644 neither for any want for this 
 will comfort more than the other will UNK-319 . see ye here . and he showed 
 them UNK-724 coins of the tribute and UNK-359 notes the worth of 
 two pound UNK-510 UNK-378 that he had he said for a song which he 
 UNK-799 . they all UNK-336 to see the UNK-199 UNK-281 in such UNK-158 of 
 money as was UNK-278 . his words were then these as UNK-236 know 
 all men he said times UNK-936 build UNK-450 UNK-234 . what means 
 this ? UNK-46 wind UNK-281 the UNK-145 but after it becomes from a 
 UNK-38 to be a rose upon the UNK-289 of time . mark me now . in UNK-95 
 UNK-656 word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh 
 that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away . this is the 
 UNK-766 . UNK-993 UNK-388 ad te UNK-751 . no question but her name is 
 UNK-622 who UNK-524 the dear UNK-688 of our UNK-83 UNK-984 and UNK-985 
 our mighty mother and mother most UNK-380 and UNK-796 UNK-322 UNK-640 
 that she UNK-718 an UNK-597 UNK-888 UNK-530 that is to wit an 
 UNK-467 of petition because she is the second eve and she won 
 us UNK-322 UNK-993 too whereas that other our UNK-214 which we are 
 linked up with by UNK-385 UNK-115 of UNK-832 sold us all 
 seed breed and generation for a penny UNK-279 . but here is the matter 
 now . or she knew him that second i say and was but creature of her 
 creature UNK-32 UNK-430 UNK-571 di UNK-775 UNK-573 or she knew him not and 
 then stands she in the one denial or UNK-44 with peter UNK-217 who 
 lives in the house that jack built and with joseph the UNK-473 UNK-186 of 
 the happy UNK-430 of all UNK-188 UNK-16 UNK-971 m . lo UNK-684 UNK-407

 UNK-350 UNK-61 UNK-901 de UNK-18 ! UNK-817 UNK-970 UNK-842 
 UNK-774 but in no case UNK-160 . and all UNK-5 out 
 upon it for a very UNK-465 word . a pregnancy without joy he said a 
 birth without UNK-352 a body without UNK-999 a belly without UNK-815 . 
 let the UNK-361 with faith and UNK-970 worship . with will will we 
 UNK-315 UNK-769 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-124 punch UNK-509 UNK-460 with his fist upon the board and would 
 sing a UNK-623 catch UNK-827 UNK-535 about a UNK-704 that was put in pod 
 of a UNK-236 UNK-491 in UNK-616 which he did UNK-377 now attack 
 the first three months she was not well UNK-827 when here nurse 
 UNK-77 from the door UNK-202 bid them hist ye should shame you nor 
 was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all 
 UNK-656 against lord andrew came for because she was UNK-528 that 
 no UNK-819 UNK-722 might UNK-525 the UNK-88 of her guard . it was an 
 ancient and a sad UNK-645 of a UNK-607 look and christian walking 
 in UNK-158 UNK-297 UNK-873 her UNK-28 and UNK-623 UNK-778 nor did her 
 UNK-116 want of it effect for UNK-508 punch UNK-509 was of them 
 all UNK-262 and they UNK-767 the UNK-78 with civil UNK-923 some and 
 UNK-12 him with UNK-254 of UNK-544 others UNK-975 they all UNK-52

 gentle UNK-958 also the times occasion as most sacred and most worthy 
 to be most sacred . in UNK-81 house rest should UNK-276 . 
 UNK-0 
 to be short this passage was UNK-268 by when master UNK-110 of mary in 
 UNK-706 UNK-582 UNK-549 asked young stephen what was the reason why he 
 had not UNK-461 to take UNK-735 UNK-805 and he answered him UNK-268 in the 
 UNK-656 UNK-932 in the UNK-185 but UNK-332 poverty all his days . master 
 UNK-10 at this made return that he had heard of those UNK-256 UNK-898 
 and how as he heard UNK-997 counted he had UNK-298 the UNK-246 virtue 
 of a UNK-512 female which was corruption of UNK-204 and they all 
 UNK-511 it too UNK-864 merry and UNK-315 to his UNK-691 . but he 
 said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was 
 the eternal son and ever virgin . UNK-241 UNK-899 grew in them the more and 
 they UNK-148 to him his curious UNK-11 of UNK-705 for the UNK-933 and 
 UNK-847 of UNK-244 as the UNK-73 use in madagascar island she 
 to be in UNK-273 of white and UNK-115 her UNK-685 in white and grain with 
 burning of UNK-520 and UNK-224 on a UNK-975 while UNK-653 UNK-903 UNK-831 and 
 the UNK-361 ut UNK-896 UNK-252 UNK-993 UNK-114 UNK-309 till she was 
 there UNK-140 . he gave them then a much UNK-976 UNK-577 UNK-491 by those 
 UNK-325 UNK-485 master john UNK-877 and master francis UNK-882 that is 
 in their UNK-893 tragedy that was UNK-799 for a like UNK-543 of lovers 
 to bed to bed was the burden of it to be played with UNK-650 
 UNK-117 upon the UNK-161 . an UNK-32 UNK-699 UNK-413 of most 
 UNK-584 UNK-859 for UNK-850 UNK-819 whom the UNK-966 
 UNK-980 of the UNK-893 have UNK-666 to the UNK-609 UNK-950 
 of UNK-113 UNK-415 . well met they were said master UNK-110 UNK-452 
 but UNK-962 young sir better were they named UNK-353 mount and UNK-492 
 for by my UNK-267 of such a UNK-829 much might come . young stephen said 
 indeed to his best UNK-168 they had but the one UNK-795 between them 
 and she of the UNK-489 to make shift with in UNK-630 UNK-821 for life ran 
 very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it . 
 greater love than this he said no man UNK-718 that a man lay down his 
 wife for his friend . go thou and do likewise . thus or words to that 
 effect UNK-322 UNK-447 UNK-121 UNK-634 professor of french letters 
 to the university of UNK-755 nor UNK-98 there ever that man to whom 
 UNK-205 was more UNK-110 . bring a stranger within thy tower it will 
 go hard but thou UNK-611 have the UNK-651 bed . UNK-1 UNK-821 pro 
 UNK-258 . and all the people shall say UNK-294 . remember UNK-385 thy 
 generations and thy days of old how thou UNK-149 little by me and by 
 my word and UNK-662 in a stranger to my gates to commit UNK-580 
 in my sight and to wax fat and kick like UNK-531 . therefore UNK-745 thou 
 UNK-251 against my light and UNK-745 made me thy lord to be the slave of 
 UNK-478 . return return clan UNK-127 forget me not o UNK-477 . why 
 UNK-745 thou done this UNK-69 before me that thou UNK-349 UNK-435 me for 
 a merchant of UNK-98 and UNK-349 deny me to the roman and to the indian of 
 dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie UNK-331 ? look forth now 
 my people upon the land of UNK-255 even from UNK-221 and from UNK-909 and 
 from UNK-690 and from the UNK-597 of UNK-20 unto a land UNK-441 with milk 
 and money . but thou UNK-745 UNK-5 me with a UNK-412 milk my moon and my 
 sun thou UNK-745 UNK-56 for ever . and thou UNK-745 left me alone for ever 
 in the dark ways of my UNK-321 and with a kiss of UNK-460 UNK-745 thou 
 UNK-166 my mouth . this UNK-615 of the interior he UNK-360 to say 
 UNK-718 not been UNK-872 by the wit of the UNK-430 nor so much as 
 mentioned for the UNK-758 from on high which brake UNK-988 gates visited a 
 darkness that was UNK-917 . UNK-646 UNK-498 UNK-962 as UNK-487

 most proper UNK-294 and UNK-109 . and as the ends and UNK-303 of 
 all things UNK-882 in some mean and measure with their UNK-853 and 
 UNK-420 that same UNK-29 UNK-347 which leads forth growth 
 from birth UNK-621 by a UNK-925 UNK-123 that UNK-284

 no man knows the UNK-727 of his UNK-660 nor to what processes we shall 
 thereby be UNK-399 nor whether to UNK-636 or to UNK-821 in the like way

 UNK-0 
 a black crack of noise in the street here UNK-211 UNK-38 back . loud on 
 left UNK-597 UNK-330 in anger awful the UNK-164 . came now the storm 
 that hist his heart . and master UNK-15 UNK-432 him have a care to UNK-344 and 
 UNK-229 as the god self was UNK-325 for his UNK-793 and UNK-645 . and 
 he that had UNK-112 challenged to be so UNK-661 UNK-22 wan as they might all 
 mark and UNK-680 together and his pitch that was before so UNK-717 UNK-59 
 was now of a sudden quite UNK-347 down and his heart UNK-35 within the 
 cage of his breast as he UNK-561 the UNK-390 of that storm . then did some 
 UNK-896 and some UNK-715 and punch UNK-509 fell hard again to his yale which 
 master UNK-10 UNK-863 he would do after and he was indeed but a word and 
 a blow on any the least colour . but the UNK-374 UNK-530 UNK-5 that an 
 old UNK-498 was in his cups it was UNK-911 UNK-942 and he would 
 not UNK-171 behind his lead . but this was only to UNK-524 his UNK-717 as 
 UNK-597 he UNK-752 in UNK-81 hall . he UNK-59 indeed at one UNK-643 to 
 UNK-397 up a heart of any grace for it UNK-330 long UNK-103 over all 
 the UNK-100 so that master UNK-501 being UNK-877 certain UNK-975 UNK-442 
 him on his UNK-905 upon that crack of doom and master bloom at the 
 UNK-891 side spoke to him UNK-71 words to UNK-60 his great fear 
 advertising how it was no other thing but a UNK-309 noise that he heard 
 the discharge of fluid from the UNK-301 look you having taken 
 place and all of the order of a natural phenomenon . 
 UNK-0 
 but was young UNK-338 fear UNK-151 by UNK-303 words ? no for he 
 had in his UNK-186 a UNK-246 named UNK-321 which could not by words be 
 done away . and was he then neither calm like the one nor UNK-877 like the 
 other ? he was neither as much as he would have liked to be either . but 
 could he not have UNK-542 to have found again as in his youth the 
 bottle UNK-800 that then he lived UNK-687 ? indeed no for grace was not 
 there to find that bottle . heard he then in that UNK-840 the voice of the 
 god UNK-411 or what UNK-892 said a UNK-309 of phenomenon ? heard ? 
 why he could not but hear unless he had UNK-208 him up the tube 
 understanding which he had not done . for through that tube he saw that 
 he was in the land of phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die 
 as he was like the rest too a passing show . and would he not accept to 
 die like the rest and pass away ? by no means would he though he must nor 
 would he make more shows according as men do with wives which phenomenon 
 has UNK-428 them to do by the book law . then UNK-561 he UNK-527 of that 
 other land which is called UNK-617 that is the land of promise 
 which UNK-586 to the king UNK-80 and shall be for ever where there 
 is no death and no birth neither UNK-120 nor UNK-817 at which all shall 
 come as many as believe on it ? yes UNK-290 had told him of that land and 
 UNK-861 had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he 
 fell in with a certain whore of an UNK-995 exterior whose name she 
 said is UNK-104 and she UNK-269 him UNK-81 from the true 
 path by her UNK-116 that she said to him as ho you pretty man turn 
 aside UNK-763 and i will show you a brave place and she lay at him so 
 UNK-783 that she had him in her UNK-302 which is named UNK-991 
 or by some learned UNK-37 UNK-174 . 
 UNK-0 
 this was it what all that company that sat there at commons in UNK-345 
 of mothers the most UNK-742 after and if they met with this whore 
 UNK-104 which was within all foul UNK-775 monsters and a 
 wicked devil they would strain the last but they would make at her and 
 know her . for regarding UNK-617 they said it was UNK-527 else 
 but notion and they could UNK-131 no thought of it for first 
 UNK-991 UNK-481 she UNK-31 them was the very UNK-22 UNK-302 and 
 in it were four UNK-182 on which were four tickets with these words 
 printed on them UNK-207 and UNK-660 and UNK-758 and UNK-139 by 
 UNK-369 and second for that foul UNK-660 UNK-599 and the monsters they 
 UNK-394 not for them for UNK-595 had given them a UNK-98 shield of 
 UNK-426 and third that they might take no hurt neither from UNK-598 
 that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was 
 named UNK-164 . so were they all in their blind fancy mr UNK-968 and mr 
 sometimes UNK-877 mr UNK-292 UNK-496 mr false franklin mr UNK-888 UNK-110 
 young UNK-25 and mr UNK-70 UNK-892 . UNK-700 o UNK-640 company 
 were ye all UNK-901 for that was the voice of the god that was in a 
 very UNK-137 rage that he would presently lift his arm up and 
 UNK-444 their souls for their UNK-998 and their UNK-136 done by them 
 UNK-823 to his word which forth to bring UNK-162 UNK-196 .

 there for a UNK-389 he had but was now better be having UNK-181 tonight 
 a strange fancy of his dame mrs UNK-28 with red UNK-193 on in a pair of 
 turkey UNK-79 which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and 
 mistress UNK-342 there that got in through UNK-142 her belly and now 
 on the UNK-424 poor body two days past her term the UNK-719 UNK-713 put 
 to it and cant deliver she UNK-852 for a bowl of UNK-271 that is a 
 UNK-295 UNK-912 up of the UNK-976 and her breath very heavy more than good 
 and should be a UNK-224 from the UNK-246 they say but god give her 
 soon issue . UNK-446 her UNK-113 chick to live i hear and lady day bit off 
 her last chicks nails that was then a UNK-275 and with other three

 be seen any fair UNK-345 with a pair of his boys off UNK-598 harbour 
 UNK-289 on the sound with a UNK-952 reel or in a UNK-604 he has 
 UNK-184 for UNK-327 and UNK-547 and UNK-227 a fine bag i hear . in sum 
 an infinite great fall of rain and all UNK-406 and will much increase 
 the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come 
 for a UNK-751 of UNK-240 UNK-677 and i hear that mr russell 
 has done a UNK-396 charm of the same UNK-742 out of the UNK-672 
 for his farmers gazette to have three things in all but this a mere 
 UNK-236 without bottom of reason for old UNK-845 and UNK-949 yet sometimes 
 they are found in the right guess with their UNK-726 no telling how . 
 UNK-0 
 with this came up UNK-10 to the feet of the table to say how the letter 
 was in that nights gazette and he made a show to find it about him 
 for he UNK-331 with an UNK-19 that he had been at UNK-931 about it but on 
 UNK-8 UNK-306 he gave over the search and was UNK-334 to sit near 
 by which he did mighty UNK-517 . he was a kind of sport gentleman that 
 went for a UNK-719 or honest UNK-962 and what UNK-386 of women 
 UNK-925 or hot UNK-47 he had it pat . to tell the truth he was mean 
 in UNK-26 and for the most part UNK-355 about the UNK-461 
 and low UNK-424 with UNK-694 UNK-689 UNK-9 UNK-372 men UNK-113 
 UNK-393 UNK-649 ladies of the UNK-999 and other UNK-757 of the 
 game or with a UNK-233 UNK-558 or a UNK-593 often at nights 
 till broad day of whom he picked up between his UNK-886 much loose 
 gossip . he took his ordinary at a UNK-50 and if he had but gotten 
 into him a mess of broken UNK-350 or a UNK-144 of UNK-194 with a bare 
 UNK-756 in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue 
 some randy UNK-330 he had from a punk or UNK-183 that every mothers son of 
 them would burst their sides . the other UNK-509 that is hearing this 
 talk asked was it poetry or a tale . faith no he says frank that was 
 his name UNK-446 all about kerry UNK-633 that are to be UNK-966 along of 
 the UNK-660 . but they can go hang says he with a UNK-269 for me with their 
 UNK-367 beef a UNK-594 on it . UNK-6 as good fish in this tin as ever came 
 out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some UNK-672 UNK-974 that 
 stood by which he had eyed UNK-814 in the UNK-477 and found the place 
 which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was UNK-468 . 
 UNK-516 UNK-312 UNK-151 says frank then in the french language that had been 
 UNK-867 to a UNK-669 that has a UNK-153 in UNK-403 and he 
 spoke french like a gentleman too . from a child this frank had been 
 a UNK-815 that his father a UNK-923 who could ill keep him to 
 school to learn his letters and the use of the UNK-636 UNK-765 at 
 the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his 
 teeth like a raw UNK-450 and was more familiar with the UNK-882 and the 
 parish UNK-409 than with his volumes . one time he would be a UNK-350 
 then a UNK-389 or a UNK-530 then UNK-527 would keep him from the UNK-927 
 and the UNK-239 main then he was for the ocean sea or to UNK-262 it on 
 the roads with the UNK-968 folk UNK-356 a UNK-432 UNK-759 by favour of 
 UNK-330 or UNK-578 UNK-893 UNK-683 or UNK-553 chicken behind a UNK-722 . he 
 had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked 
 pockets as many more to his father the UNK-923 who shed a UNK-395 
 of tears as often as he saw him . what says mr UNK-27 with his hands 
 across that was UNK-477 to know the UNK-230 of it will they UNK-184 
 all ? i protest i saw them but this day morning going to the liverpool 
 boats says he . i can UNK-268 believe UNK-446 so bad says he . and he had 
 experience of the like UNK-771 UNK-850 and of UNK-10 UNK-830 UNK-884 and 
 UNK-353 wool having been some years before UNK-655 for mr joseph UNK-624 
 a worthy UNK-533 that drove his trade for live stock and UNK-64 
 auctions hard by mr UNK-758 lows yard in UNK-182 street . i question with 
 you there says he . more like UNK-446 the UNK-98 or the timber tongue . mr 
 stephen a little moved but very UNK-769 told him no such matter and 
 that he had UNK-182 from the UNK-762 chief UNK-324 UNK-413 
 him for the hospitality that was sending over doctor UNK-733 the 
 UNK-904 UNK-336 in all UNK-164 with a UNK-38 or two of UNK-158 to 
 take the bull by the UNK-597 . come come says mr vincent plain dealing . 
 hell find himself on the UNK-597 of a UNK-614 if he UNK-970 with a 
 bull thats irish says he . irish by name and irish by nature says mr 
 stephen and he sent the UNK-556 UNK-337 about an irish bull in an english 
 UNK-911 . i UNK-131 you says mr UNK-110 . it is that same bull that was 
 sent to our island by farmer nicholas the UNK-252 UNK-643 of them 
 all with an emerald ring in his nose . true for you says mr vincent 
 cross the table and a UNK-650 into the bargain says he and a UNK-337 
 and a UNK-237 bull says he never shit on UNK-292 . he had UNK-597 
 UNK-558 a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet UNK-62 breath coming out of 
 his UNK-304 so that the women of our island leaving UNK-229 and 
 UNK-850 followed after him hanging his UNK-836 in UNK-342 . 
 what for that says mr UNK-110 but before he came over farmer nicholas 
 that was a UNK-378 had him properly UNK-342 by a college of doctors who 
 were no better off than himself . so be off now says he and do all my 
 UNK-664 german the lord harry tells you and take a farmers UNK-697 and 
 with that he UNK-50 his UNK-357 very UNK-214 . but the UNK-387 and the 
 UNK-697 stood him friend says mr vincent for to make up he taught him 
 a trick worth two of the other so that UNK-685 wife UNK-264 and UNK-265 to 
 this day UNK-467 that they would rather any time of the month UNK-365 
 in his ear in the dark of a UNK-612 or get a UNK-313 on the UNK-157 from his 
 long holy tongue than lie with the finest UNK-195 young UNK-352 in 
 the four fields of all ireland . another then put in his word and they 
 dressed him says he in a point shift and UNK-470 with a UNK-978 and 
 UNK-304 and UNK-996 on his UNK-982 and UNK-852 his UNK-244 and UNK-866 him 
 all over with UNK-851 oil and built UNK-891 for him at every turn of 
 the road with a gold UNK-520 in each full of the best hay in the market 
 so that he could UNK-300 and UNK-834 to his hearts content . by this time the 
 father of the UNK-620 for so they called him was grown so heavy that 
 he could UNK-268 walk to UNK-412 . to remedy which our UNK-435 UNK-913 and 
 UNK-652 brought him his UNK-204 in their UNK-405 and as soon as his 
 belly was full he would rear up on his UNK-511 UNK-344 to show their 
 UNK-358 a mystery and UNK-612 and UNK-78 out of him in UNK-988 language 
 and they all after him . UNK-42 says another and so UNK-10 was he that he 
 would suffer UNK-527 to grow in all the land but green grass for himself 
 for that was the only colour to his mind and there was a board put up 
 on a UNK-49 in the middle of the island with a printed notice saying 
 by the lord harry green is the grass that grows on the ground . and 
 says mr UNK-110 if ever he got UNK-111 of a UNK-907 in UNK-451 or 
 the UNK-211 of UNK-308 or a UNK-840 in UNK-865 that was UNK-874 as much 
 as a UNK-335 of UNK-428 or a bag of UNK-32 out UNK-25 run UNK-74 over half 
 the UNK-726 UNK-108 up with his UNK-597 whatever was UNK-887 and all 
 by lord UNK-717 orders . there was bad blood between them at first says 
 mr vincent and the lord harry called farmer nicholas all the old UNK-322 
 in the world and an old UNK-611 that kept seven UNK-460 in his house 
 and ill UNK-632 in his matters says he . ill make that animal smell 
 hell says he with the help of that good UNK-775 my father left me . but 
 one evening says mr UNK-110 when the lord harry was cleaning his royal 
 UNK-77 to go to dinner after winning a UNK-255 he had UNK-917 UNK-496 for 
 himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row 
 with UNK-22 he discovered in himself a wonderful UNK-282 to a bull 
 and on picking up a UNK-837 UNK-968 that he kept in the UNK-734 
 he found sure enough that he was a UNK-679 UNK-659 of the famous 
 champion bull of the UNK-490 UNK-20 UNK-700 which is good UNK-628 latin for 
 boss of the show . after that says mr vincent the lord harry put his 
 head into a UNK-633 UNK-568 in the presence of all his UNK-488 
 and pulling it out again told them all his new name . then with the 
 water running off him he got into an old UNK-681 and skirt that had 
 UNK-386 to his UNK-933 and bought a grammar of the UNK-988 language 
 to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal 
 UNK-400 which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went 
 out for a walk he filled his pockets with UNK-140 to write it upon what 
 took his fancy the side of a rock or a UNK-377 table or a UNK-352 of 
 cotton or a UNK-895 . in short he and the bull of ireland were soon as 
 fast friends as an UNK-865 and a shirt . they were says mr stephen and 
 the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward as 
 the UNK-639 women were all of one mind made a UNK-880 UNK-127 loaded 
 themselves and their UNK-449 of UNK-890 on UNK-738 set all UNK-561 
 UNK-705 UNK-651 the yards UNK-418 their UNK-856 UNK-734 to spread three 
 sheets in the wind put her head between wind and water UNK-441 anchor 
 UNK-808 her UNK-396 ran up the UNK-236 roger gave three times three let the 
 UNK-990 run pushed off in their UNK-355 and put to sea to recover 
 the main of america . which was the occasion says mr vincent of the 
 UNK-373 by a UNK-167 of that UNK-206 UNK-113 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 pope UNK-321 but a UNK-364 . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 a UNK-54 a man for a that . 
 UNK-0 
 our worthy UNK-930 mr UNK-226 UNK-4 now appeared in the UNK-102 
 as the students were finishing their UNK-763 accompanied with a friend 
 whom he had just UNK-289 a young gentleman his name UNK-193 UNK-129 
 who had late come to town it being his intention to buy a colour or a 
 UNK-281 in the UNK-884 and list for the wars . mr UNK-4 was civil 
 enough to express some UNK-238 of it all the more as it UNK-615 with a 
 project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched 
 on . UNK-91 he handed round to the company a set of UNK-583 cards 
 which he had had printed that day at mr UNK-862 bearing a legend 
 printed in fair UNK-184 mr UNK-226 UNK-4 . UNK-480 and UNK-144 . 
 UNK-947 island . his project as he went on to UNK-150 was to UNK-387 
 from the round of idle UNK-744 such as form the chief business of sir 
 UNK-161 UNK-59 and sir UNK-620 UNK-997 in town and to UNK-665 himself 
 to the UNK-149 task for which our UNK-919 UNK-578 has been framed . well 
 let us hear of it good my friend said mr UNK-110 . i make no doubt it 
 UNK-260 of UNK-105 . come be UNK-154 both . UNK-446 as cheap sitting as 
 standing . mr UNK-4 accepted of the invitation and UNK-438 upon 
 his design told his UNK-614 that he had been led into this thought by 
 a consideration of the causes of UNK-496 both the UNK-776 and the 
 UNK-632 whether the UNK-264 in its turn were due to UNK-370 
 UNK-512 or to a UNK-885 of the balance as well as whether the 
 UNK-885 UNK-360 from defects UNK-13 or from UNK-416 
 acquired . it UNK-619 him UNK-297 he said to see the UNK-726 UNK-447 
 UNK-893 of its UNK-983 UNK-796 and to reflect upon so many UNK-768 
 females with rich UNK-566 a UNK-659 to the UNK-331 UNK-560 who hide their 
 UNK-633 under a UNK-816 in an UNK-250 UNK-308 or lose their UNK-145 
 bloom in the UNK-950 of some UNK-409 UNK-955 when they might 
 UNK-530 the UNK-579 of happiness UNK-969 the UNK-435 jewel of 
 their sex when a hundred pretty UNK-13 were at hand to UNK-806 this he 
 assured them made his heart UNK-955 . to UNK-234 this UNK-80 which 
 he concluded due to a UNK-923 of UNK-31 heat having advised with 
 certain UNK-230 of worth and UNK-247 into this matter he had 
 resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the UNK-101 of UNK-947 
 island from its holder lord UNK-548 de UNK-684 a UNK-771 gentleman of 
 note much in favour with our UNK-41 party . he proposed to set up 
 there a national UNK-410 farm to be named UNK-705 with an UNK-668 
 UNK-378 and UNK-671 after the fashion of egypt and to offer his UNK-620 
 UNK-941 services for the UNK-487 of any female of what grade of life 
 UNK-560 who should there direct to him with the desire of UNK-120 the 
 functions of her natural . money was no object he said nor would he 
 take a penny for his UNK-931 . the UNK-279 UNK-958 no less than the 
 UNK-593 lady of fashion if so be their UNK-625 and their UNK-34 
 were warm UNK-420 for their UNK-523 would find in him their man . 
 for his UNK-327 he UNK-272 how he would feed himself exclusively upon a 
 diet of UNK-311 UNK-501 and fish and UNK-324 there the flesh of these 
 latter UNK-819 UNK-259 being highly recommended for his purpose both 
 UNK-263 and UNK-807 with a blade of UNK-349 and a pod or two of UNK-545 
 UNK-892 . after this UNK-943 which he delivered with much UNK-635 of 
 UNK-671 mr UNK-4 in a UNK-429 put off from his hat a UNK-5 with 
 which he had UNK-606 it . they both it seems had been UNK-184 by the 
 rain and for all their UNK-938 their pace had taken water as might be 
 observed by mr UNK-653 UNK-837 of a UNK-58 grey which was now 
 somewhat UNK-263 . his project meanwhile was very UNK-639 UNK-940 
 by his UNK-852 and won UNK-656 UNK-991 from all though mr UNK-110 of 
 UNK-928 UNK-116 to it asking with a UNK-738 air did he purpose also 
 to carry UNK-918 to newcastle . mr UNK-4 however made court to the 
 UNK-250 by an apt UNK-712 from the classics which as it UNK-210 
 upon his memory seemed to him a sound and UNK-210 support of his 
 UNK-446 UNK-950 ac UNK-741 UNK-356 UNK-120 UNK-294 o UNK-992 
 ut UNK-975 UNK-504 UNK-198 UNK-485 UNK-84 UNK-69 
 UNK-358 UNK-727 UNK-914 UNK-918 UNK-845 UNK-645 
 UNK-203 UNK-248 UNK-735 UNK-641 while for those of UNK-896 
 wit he drove home his point by UNK-880 of the animal kingdom more 
 suitable to their stomach the buck and doe of the forest UNK-192 the 
 UNK-490 UNK-510 and duck . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-307 himself not a little upon his UNK-916 being indeed a proper 
 man of person this UNK-878 now applied himself to his dress with 
 UNK-961 of some heat upon the sudden UNK-438 of the UNK-609 
 while the company UNK-652 their UNK-868 upon the project he had 
 advanced . the young gentleman his friend UNK-794 as he was at a 
 passage that had late UNK-552 him could not UNK-672 to tell it his 
 nearest UNK-379 . mr UNK-4 now UNK-491 the table asked for whom 
 were those UNK-685 and UNK-253 and seeing the stranger he made him 
 a civil bow and said pray sir was you in need of any professional 
 assistance we could give ? who upon his offer UNK-433 him very 
 UNK-496 though UNK-235 his proper distance and replied that he was 
 come there about a lady now an UNK-857 of UNK-81 house that was in an 
 interesting condition poor body from UNK-95 UNK-726 and here he UNK-28 
 a deep UNK-317 to know if her happiness had yet taken place . mr UNK-110 
 to turn the table took on to ask of mr UNK-4 himself whether 
 his UNK-424 UNK-366 upon which he UNK-456 him UNK-986 an 
 UNK-728 UNK-314 in the UNK-618 UNK-997 or male UNK-656 or was due 
 as with the noted physician mr austin UNK-971 to a wolf in the stomach . 
 for answer mr UNK-4 in a gale of UNK-31 at his UNK-860 UNK-245 
 himself UNK-33 below the UNK-230 UNK-963 with an UNK-976 UNK-607 
 UNK-22 of mother UNK-50 the most excellent creature of her sex though 
 UNK-446 UNK-47 UNK-23 a UNK-999 UNK-6 a belly that never UNK-135 a UNK-603 . 
 this was so happy a UNK-57 that it UNK-201 the storm of UNK-899 and UNK-163 
 the whole room into the most violent UNK-309 of delight . the UNK-755 
 UNK-320 had run on in the same UNK-249 of UNK-376 but for some UNK-684 in the 
 UNK-927 . 
 UNK-0 
 here the UNK-584 who was none other than the UNK-739 student a little 
 UNK-965 of a fellow blond as UNK-963 UNK-245 in the UNK-36 fashion 
 with the young gentleman and UNK-168 the narrative at a UNK-454 
 point having desired his UNK-689 with a UNK-727 UNK-130 to have the 
 UNK-693 to pass him a UNK-110 of UNK-107 waters at the same time by 
 a UNK-754 UNK-60 of the head a whole century of UNK-727 breeding had 
 not achieved so nice a UNK-359 to which was united an equivalent but 
 contrary balance of the bottle asked the UNK-646 as UNK-722 as was ever 
 done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it . UNK-101 UNK-396 sr 
 noble stranger said he UNK-200 et UNK-376 UNK-857 . that you may 
 and very UNK-798 . there wanted nothing but this cup to crown my 
 UNK-560 . but UNK-336 heaven was i left with but a UNK-584 in my wallet 
 and a UNK-95 of water from the well my god i would accept of them and 
 find it in my heart to UNK-456 down upon the ground and give thanks to 
 the powers above for the happiness UNK-169 me by the UNK-599 of good 
 things . with these words he UNK-596 the UNK-68 to his lips took a 
 UNK-840 UNK-643 of the UNK-107 UNK-665 his hair and opening his 
 UNK-186 out UNK-388 a UNK-136 that hung from a silk UNK-402 that very 
 picture which he had UNK-879 ever since her hand had wrote UNK-343 . 
 UNK-248 upon those features with a world of UNK-145 ah UNK-856 he 
 said had you but UNK-809 her as i did with these eyes at that affecting 
 instant with her UNK-888 UNK-983 and her new UNK-212 cap a gift for her 
 UNK-591 as she told me UNK-74 in such an UNK-117 disorder of so 
 UNK-433 a UNK-145 UNK-775 my UNK-212 even you UNK-856 had been 
 UNK-439 by generous nature to deliver yourself UNK-571 into the hands of 
 such an enemy or to quit the field for ever . i declare i was never so 
 touched in all my life . god i thank thee as the author of my days ! 
 UNK-697 happy will he be whom so UNK-677 a creature will bless with her 
 UNK-564 . a UNK-317 of UNK-874 gave UNK-118 to these words and having 
 replaced the UNK-136 in his UNK-186 he UNK-702 his eye and UNK-279 again . 
 UNK-711 UNK-429 of UNK-586 to all thy creatures how great 
 and universal must be that UNK-195 of thy UNK-299 which can hold in 
 UNK-346 the free and the bond the simple UNK-432 and the polished UNK-921 
 the lover in the UNK-365 of UNK-573 passion and the husband of UNK-948 
 years . but indeed sir i UNK-588 from the point . how UNK-907 and 
 UNK-296 are all our UNK-600 UNK-345 . UNK-684 ! he UNK-751 in 
 UNK-644 . would to god that UNK-475 had but remembered me to take my 
 UNK-382 along ! i could UNK-955 to think of it . then though it had UNK-207 
 seven showers we were neither of us a penny the worse . but UNK-424 me 
 he UNK-5 UNK-374 hand to his UNK-133 tomorrow will be a new day and 
 thousand UNK-964 i know of a UNK-461 de UNK-788 UNK-856 UNK-227 
 from whom i can have for a UNK-690 as UNK-817 a UNK-382 of the french fashion 
 as ever kept a lady from UNK-93 . UNK-276 tut ! UNK-155 le UNK-75 
 UNK-573 in my friend UNK-856 moore that most accomplished traveller 
 i have just UNK-871 a half bottle UNK-962 UNK-0 in a circle of the best UNK-115 
 of the town is my authority that in cape horn UNK-901 UNK-445 they 
 have a rain that will wet through any even the UNK-461 UNK-382 . a 
 UNK-669 of that violence he tells me sans UNK-860 has sent more 
 than one UNK-155 fellow in good UNK-477 UNK-635 to another world . 
 UNK-406 ! a UNK-690 ! UNK-155 UNK-856 UNK-15 . the UNK-713 things are dear at a 
 UNK-57 . one UNK-148 were it no bigger than a fairy UNK-141 is worth ten 
 such UNK-667 . no woman of any wit would wear one . my dear kitty told me 
 today that she would dance in a UNK-301 before ever she would UNK-324 in 
 such an UNK-18 of salvation for as she UNK-610 me UNK-521 UNK-667 and 
 UNK-387 in my ear though there was none to snap her words but UNK-284 
 UNK-854 dame nature by the divine UNK-697 has UNK-935 it in 
 our hearts and it has become a household word that il y a UNK-757 UNK-426 
 for which the UNK-636 of our original UNK-157 in other circumstances a 
 breach of the UNK-382 is the UNK-62 UNK-376 the only UNK-912 . the 
 first said she and here my pretty UNK-499 as i handed her to her 
 UNK-155 to fix my attention gently UNK-303 with her tongue the outer 
 chamber of my ear the first is a bath . . . but at this point a bell 
 UNK-850 in the hall cut short a UNK-649 which promised so UNK-33 for 
 the UNK-450 of our store of knowledge . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-22 the general UNK-841 UNK-855 of the assembly a bell UNK-459 and while 
 all were UNK-415 what might be the cause miss UNK-53 entered and 
 having spoken a few words in a low tone to young mr UNK-110 retired with 
 a UNK-240 bow to the company . the presence even for a moment among a 
 party of UNK-828 of a woman UNK-102 with every quality of UNK-423 and 
 not less severe than beautiful UNK-694 the UNK-562 UNK-179 even of 
 the most UNK-751 but her departure was the signal for an UNK-585 of 
 UNK-725 . strike me silly said UNK-509 a low fellow who was UNK-415 . 
 a UNK-395 fine bit of UNK-966 ! ill be UNK-446 she has UNK-290 
 you . what you dog ? have you a way with them ? UNK-59 UNK-685 UNK-172 
 so said mr UNK-15 . the UNK-453 manner it is that they use in the UNK-56 
 UNK-517 . UNK-455 does not doctor UNK-907 chuck the UNK-71 there under the 
 UNK-333 . as i look to be saved i had it from my kitty who has been UNK-722 
 there any time these seven months . UNK-3 doctor UNK-5 the young 
 blood in the UNK-837 UNK-719 UNK-945 a UNK-298 UNK-231 and with UNK-462 
 UNK-994 of his body how you do UNK-764 a body ! UNK-475 the man ! bless 
 me im all of a UNK-155 UNK-279 . why UNK-14 as bad as dear little father 
 UNK-773 that you are ! may this pot of four half UNK-224 me UNK-5 
 UNK-509 if she UNK-91 in the family way . i knows a lady whats got a 
 white UNK-446 quick as i UNK-416 eyes on her . the young surgeon however 
 rose and UNK-113 the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just 
 then informed him that he was needed in the ward . UNK-607 providence 
 had been pleased to put a period to the UNK-346 of the lady who was 
 UNK-150 which she had UNK-618 with a UNK-82 UNK-637 and she had 
 given birth to a UNK-267 boy . i want UNK-435 said he with those 
 who without wit to UNK-761 or learning to UNK-937 UNK-81 an UNK-238 
 profession which saving the UNK-510 due to the UNK-614 is the greatest 
 power for happiness upon the earth . i am positive when i say that if 
 need were i could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of 
 her noble UNK-541 which so far from being a UNK-110 should be a 
 UNK-520 incentive in the human breast . i UNK-216 away with them . what ? 
 UNK-139 such an one the UNK-677 miss UNK-53 who is the UNK-341 of 
 her own sex and the UNK-944 of ours ? and at an instant the most 
 UNK-990 that can UNK-178 a UNK-946 child of clay ? UNK-878 the thought ! i 
 UNK-465 to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such UNK-953 
 have been UNK-247 and where no right UNK-510 is rendered to mother and 
 UNK-685 in house of UNK-140 . having delivered himself of this UNK-598 he 
 UNK-276 those present on the by and UNK-43 to the door . a UNK-208 
 of approval UNK-507 from all and some were for UNK-377 the low UNK-164 
 without more UNK-634 a design which would have been UNK-984 nor would 
 he have received more than his bare UNK-251 had he not UNK-730 his 
 UNK-848 by UNK-950 with a UNK-353 UNK-722 for he UNK-331 a 
 round hand that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew 
 breath . UNK-336 my UNK-87 said he them was always the UNK-187 of 
 honest frank UNK-509 which i was UNK-338 up most particular to UNK-88 thy 
 father and thy mother that had the best hand to a UNK-555 or a UNK-476 
 UNK-494 as you ever see what i always looks back on with a loving heart .

 to UNK-941 to mr bloom who after his first entry had been conscious of 
 some UNK-763 UNK-500 which he however had UNK-618 with as being the fruits 
 of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not 
 UNK-47 . the young UNK-15 it is true were as full of UNK-347 
 as UNK-938 children the words of their UNK-788 discussions 
 were UNK-975 understood and not often nice their UNK-772 and 
 UNK-562 UNK-996 were such that his UNK-170 UNK-642 from nor were 
 they UNK-19 UNK-629 of the UNK-382 though their fund of 
 strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf . but the word of mr UNK-509 
 was an UNK-760 language for him for he UNK-411 the UNK-208 that 
 seemed to him a UNK-532 creature of a UNK-967 UNK-675 born out 
 of UNK-705 and UNK-243 like a UNK-765 UNK-152 and feet first into the 
 world which the UNK-813 of the surgeons UNK-780 in his UNK-241 UNK-256 indeed 
 a colour to so as to put him in thought of that missing link of 
 creations chain UNK-876 by the late UNK-389 mr darwin . it was now 
 for more than the middle span of our UNK-302 years that he had passed 
 through the thousand UNK-736 of existence and being of a UNK-279 
 UNK-41 and self a man of rare forecast he had UNK-980 his heart 
 to UNK-153 all UNK-844 of a rising UNK-583 and by UNK-53 them 
 with the UNK-973 UNK-11 foster within his breast that UNK-259 
 of UNK-90 which base minds UNK-715 at UNK-307 UNK-164 UNK-589 and all find 
 UNK-934 and but UNK-934 . to those who create themselves UNK-115 at the 
 cost of UNK-95 UNK-125 a UNK-158 of mind which he never did hold 
 with to them he would UNK-743 neither to bear the name nor to UNK-211 
 the tradition of a proper breeding while for such that having lost 
 all UNK-495 can lose no more there remained the sharp UNK-826 of 
 experience to cause their UNK-490 to beat a UNK-218 and UNK-573 
 retreat . not but what he could feel with UNK-568 youth which caring 
 UNK-527 for the UNK-388 of UNK-942 or the UNK-248 of the severe is ever 
 as the UNK-861 fancy of the holy writer UNK-859 it for eating of the 
 tree UNK-1 it yet not so far forth as to UNK-237 humanity upon any 
 condition UNK-560 towards a UNK-672 when she was about her UNK-981 
 occasions . to conclude while from the sisters words he had UNK-282 
 upon a UNK-183 delivery he was however it must be owned not a little 
 UNK-319 by the intelligence that the issue so UNK-989 after an 
 UNK-868 of such UNK-51 now UNK-243 once more to the mercy as well as to 
 the UNK-161 of the supreme being .

 accordingly he broke his mind to his UNK-379 saying that to express 
 his notion of the thing his opinion who ought not UNK-563 to express 
 one was that one must have a cold constitution and a UNK-260 genius not 
 to be UNK-903 by this UNK-74 news of the UNK-633 of her UNK-919 
 since she had been in such pain through no fault of UNK-349 . the UNK-677 
 young blade said it was her UNK-624 that put her in that UNK-312 
 or at least it ought to be unless she were another UNK-554 UNK-645 . i 
 must UNK-214 you said mr UNK-877 UNK-374 on the table so as to 
 UNK-632 a UNK-953 comment of emphasis old glory UNK-948 was round 
 again today an elderly man with UNK-993 UNK-882 through his 
 nose a request to have word of UNK-16 my life as he calls her . i 
 UNK-432 him hold himself in UNK-461 for that the event would burst UNK-11 . 
 UNK-539 ill be round with you . i UNK-216 but UNK-93 the UNK-225 UNK-190 of 
 the old UNK-832 that could still knock another child out of her . all fell 
 to UNK-822 of it each after his own fashion though the same young 
 blade held with his former view that another than her UNK-692 had 
 been the man in the gap a clerk in orders a UNK-934 UNK-729 or 
 an UNK-148 vendor of articles needed in every household . UNK-663 
 UNK-296 the guest with himself the UNK-328 UNK-655 faculty of 
 UNK-65 UNK-845 by them that the UNK-424 UNK-773 and the 
 UNK-850 theatre should be the UNK-787 of such UNK-8 that the 
 mere acquisition of academic titles should UNK-207 to transform in a 
 UNK-429 of time these UNK-70 of UNK-216 into UNK-37 practitioners of 
 an art which most men UNK-259 UNK-926 have UNK-38 the UNK-149 . but 
 he further added it is UNK-229 to UNK-515 the UNK-640 feelings that in 
 common UNK-105 them for i have more than once observed that birds of a 
 UNK-227 laugh together . 
 UNK-0 
 but with what fitness let it be asked of the noble lord his UNK-186 
 has this alien whom the UNK-248 of a UNK-336 prince has admitted 
 to civic rights UNK-774 himself the lord UNK-879 of our 
 internal UNK-607 ? where is now that UNK-980 which UNK-606 should have 
 UNK-728 ? during the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary 
 advantage with his UNK-937 did this UNK-229 to his kind not UNK-495 that 
 moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant 
 at will while he UNK-515 for the security of his four per cents ? has he 
 forgotten this as he UNK-732 all benefits received ? or is it that from 
 being a UNK-911 of others he has become at last his own UNK-149 as he is 
 if report UNK-747 him not his own and his only UNK-523 ? far be it from 
 UNK-171 to UNK-995 the UNK-945 of a UNK-667 lady the daughter of 
 a UNK-995 major or to cast the most distant reflections upon her 
 virtue but if he challenges attention there as it was indeed highly his 
 interest not to have done then be it so . UNK-188 woman she has been 
 too long and too UNK-859 denied her legitimate UNK-261 to 
 listen to his UNK-120 with any other feeling than the UNK-14 of 
 the desperate . he says this a UNK-823 of UNK-905 a very UNK-814 in his 
 UNK-101 who did not UNK-956 UNK-412 of the ties of nature to attempt 
 UNK-565 UNK-299 with a female domestic drawn from the lowest UNK-183 
 of society ! UNK-376 had the UNK-175 UNK-770 not been her UNK-976 
 angel it had gone with her as hard as with UNK-133 the egyptian ! in the 
 question of the UNK-527 lands his UNK-404 UNK-26 is UNK-384 and in 
 mr UNK-160 hearing brought upon him from an UNK-94 UNK-878 a UNK-105 
 UNK-790 UNK-87 in terms as UNK-110 as they were UNK-955 . it ill 
 becomes him to UNK-867 that gospel . has he not UNK-221 home a UNK-948 
 that lies UNK-112 for the want of the UNK-111 ? a UNK-158 UNK-426 
 at UNK-604 is second nature and an UNK-521 in middle life . if he must 
 UNK-284 his UNK-695 of UNK-477 in UNK-573 and UNK-839 of UNK-873 taste 
 to restore to health a generation of UNK-826 UNK-664 let his 
 practice consist better with the UNK-713 that now UNK-806 him . his 
 UNK-261 breast is the repository of secrets which UNK-878 is UNK-258 
 to UNK-502 . the UNK-361 suggestions of some UNK-238 beauty may console him for 
 a UNK-188 UNK-377 and UNK-421 but this new UNK-261 of UNK-905 and 
 UNK-984 of UNK-319 is at his best an exotic tree which when UNK-868 in 
 its native UNK-758 UNK-666 and UNK-216 and was UNK-674 in UNK-695 
 but UNK-379 to a UNK-362 more UNK-55 its roots have lost their

 the news was UNK-347 with a UNK-761 UNK-371 the UNK-805 
 usage of the sublime UNK-580 by the second female UNK-420 to the 
 junior medical officer in residence who in his turn announced to the 
 delegation that an UNK-759 had been born when he had UNK-577 himself 
 to the womens apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the 
 UNK-83 in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic 
 affairs and the members of the UNK-906 council silent in UNK-420

 UNK-735 a licence which the UNK-197 absence of UNK-192 and 
 UNK-635 rendered the easier broke out at once into a UNK-22 of 
 UNK-591 . in UNK-398 the voice of mr UNK-532 bloom was heard UNK-932 
 to urge to UNK-714 to UNK-499 . the moment was too UNK-660 for the 
 display of that UNK-49 which seemed the only bond of union among 
 UNK-34 so UNK-678 . every phase of the situation was UNK-84

 consequence of UNK-651 reunion of the UNK-630 UNK-456 along the UNK-656 
 line so that as he said one ear could hear what the other spoke the

 a word all the cases of human UNK-841 which UNK-613 has classified 
 in his UNK-616 with UNK-554 illustrations . the UNK-91 
 problems of UNK-326 and UNK-409 medicine were examined with as much 
 animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as 
 the UNK-866 to a UNK-699 woman to step over a UNK-918 UNK-689 
 by her movement the UNK-783 should UNK-208 her creature and 
 the UNK-990 upon her in the event of a UNK-157 UNK-983 and 
 UNK-701 UNK-940 to place her hand against that part of her 
 person which long usage has UNK-854 as the seat of UNK-280 .

 UNK-560 UNK-761 mark and UNK-501 UNK-103 were alleged by one as a 
 UNK-681 UNK-173 and natural hypothetical explanation of those UNK-936 
 the case of UNK-385 UNK-670 UNK-903 was not forgotten or UNK-997 
 infants occasionally born . the hypothesis of a UNK-262 memory advanced 
 by the UNK-218 UNK-432 and worthy of the UNK-466 traditions of 
 the land he stood for UNK-339 in such cases an arrest of UNK-425 
 development at some stage UNK-742 to the human . an UNK-49 
 UNK-858 sustained against both these views with such heat as almost 
 carried conviction the theory of UNK-18 between women and the males 
 of UNK-948 his authority being his own UNK-91 in support of UNK-699 
 such as that of the UNK-734 which the genius of the elegant latin poet 
 has handed down to us in the pages of his UNK-646 . the impression 
 made by his words was immediate but UNK-629 . it was UNK-596 as easily 
 as it had been UNK-685 by an UNK-818 from mr candidate UNK-4 in 
 that UNK-249 of UNK-762 which none better than he knew how to affect 
 UNK-780 as the UNK-92 object of desire a nice clean old man . 
 UNK-312 a heated argument having UNK-149 between mr UNK-858 
 UNK-501 and mr candidate UNK-15 regarding the UNK-91 and UNK-519 
 UNK-614 created in the event of one UNK-456 twin UNK-210 the other 
 the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to mr UNK-532 bloom 
 for instant UNK-87 to mr UNK-544 UNK-647 UNK-1 . UNK-282 silent 
 whether the better to show by UNK-927 gravity that curious UNK-491 
 of the UNK-157 with which he was UNK-890 or in UNK-268 to an UNK-362 
 voice he delivered briefly and as some thought UNK-251 the 
 UNK-746 ordinance UNK-866 man to put UNK-742 what god has 
 joined . 
 UNK-0 
 but UNK-417 tale began to freeze them with horror . he UNK-270 up the 
 scene before them . the secret panel beside the UNK-345 UNK-712 back and 
 in the UNK-213 appeared . . . UNK-38 ! which of us did not feel his flesh 
 UNK-844 ! he had a portfolio full of celtic literature in one hand in the 
 other a UNK-175 marked poison . surprise horror UNK-820 were UNK-905 
 on all faces while he eyed them with a UNK-675 UNK-205 . i anticipated some 
 such reception he began with an UNK-553 laugh for which it seems 
 history is to blame . yes it is true . i am the UNK-1 of samuel 
 UNK-337 . and how i am UNK-344 ! the UNK-597 has no UNK-829 for me . this 
 is the appearance is on me . UNK-747 and ages what way would i be UNK-807 
 at all he UNK-606 UNK-416 and i UNK-132 dublin this while back 
 with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a UNK-524 or a 
 UNK-244 ? my hell and UNK-192 is in this life . it is what i tried 
 to UNK-878 my crime . UNK-473 UNK-31 the UNK-114 language 
 he UNK-473 some UNK-237 he raised the UNK-175 to his lips camping 
 out . in UNK-398 ! his UNK-742 UNK-951 me . UNK-261 is my only hope . . . ah ! 
 destruction ! the black UNK-825 ! with a cry he suddenly UNK-134 and the 
 panel UNK-712 back . an instant later his head appeared in the door opposite 
 and said meet me at UNK-761 row station at ten past eleven . he was 
 gone . tears UNK-258 from the eyes of the UNK-56 host . the UNK-128 
 raised his hand to heaven UNK-289 the UNK-144 of UNK-636 ! the 
 sage repeated UNK-985 UNK-924 . the UNK-671 is he who would enjoy 
 without UNK-861 the UNK-557 UNK-942 for a thing done . UNK-417 
 overcome by UNK-370 UNK-167 . the mystery was UNK-835 . UNK-38 was the 
 third brother . his real name was UNK-337 . the black UNK-825 was himself 
 the ghost of his own father . he UNK-59 drugs to UNK-878 . for this 
 relief much thanks . the lonely house by the UNK-963 is UNK-834 . 
 no soul will live there . the spider UNK-728 her web in the UNK-130 . 
 the UNK-286 rat peers from his hole . a UNK-217 is on it . it is UNK-173 . 
 UNK-316 ground .

 what is the age of the soul of man ? as she UNK-718 the virtue of the 
 UNK-740 to change her UNK-641 at every new approach to be gay with the 
 merry and UNK-938 with the UNK-571 so too is her age UNK-568 as 
 her mood . no longer is UNK-27 as he UNK-805 there UNK-455 UNK-574 
 the UNK-238 of UNK-468 that UNK-928 agent of publicity and holder of a 
 UNK-511 substance in the funds . a score of years are UNK-944 away . he is 
 young UNK-27 . there as in a UNK-967 arrangement a mirror within 
 a mirror hey UNK-333 ! he UNK-396 himself . that young figure of then 
 is seen UNK-722 UNK-306 walking on a UNK-394 morning from the old 
 house in UNK-839 street to the high school his UNK-788 on 
 him UNK-14 and in it a UNK-582 UNK-984 of UNK-853 UNK-170 a mothers 
 thought . or it is the same figure a year or so gone over in his first 
 hard hat ah that was a day ! already on the road a UNK-363 
 traveller for the family firm equipped with an UNK-752 a UNK-429 
 UNK-185 not for show only his case of bright UNK-894 UNK-194 ! 
 a thing now of the past ! and a UNK-295 of compliant UNK-479 for this 
 or that UNK-133 UNK-450 UNK-832 it out upon her UNK-455 or for 
 a UNK-346 virgin UNK-831 UNK-622 but the heart ? tell me ! his 
 studied UNK-974 . the UNK-111 the smile but more than these the dark 
 eyes and UNK-725 address brought home at UNK-477 many a commission 
 to the head of the firm UNK-154 with UNK-413 pipe after like UNK-32 in 
 the UNK-562 UNK-261 a meal of UNK-35 you may be sure is UNK-141 
 reading through round UNK-86 UNK-815 some paper from the europe of a 
 month before . but hey UNK-333 the mirror is UNK-98 on and the young 
 UNK-310 UNK-439 UNK-7 UNK-263 to a tiny UNK-531 within the 
 UNK-688 . now he is himself UNK-562 and these about him might be his 
 sons . who can say ? the wise father knows his own child . he thinks of a 
 UNK-289 night in UNK-258 street hard by the UNK-743 stores there the 
 first . together she is a poor UNK-911 a child of shame yours and mine 
 and of all for a bare UNK-378 and her UNK-474 together they hear 
 the heavy UNK-150 of the watch as two UNK-528 shadows pass the new royal 
 university . UNK-909 ! UNK-909 kelly ! he will never forget the name ever 
 remember the night first night the UNK-507 . they are UNK-640 
 in UNK-650 darkness the UNK-527 with the UNK-21 and in an instant 
 UNK-671 ! light shall flood the world . did heart UNK-981 to heart ? UNK-376 
 fair reader . in a breath UNK-590 done UNK-812 ! back ! it must not be ! in 
 terror the poor girl UNK-278 away through the UNK-964 . she is the bride of 
 darkness a daughter of night . she dare not bear the UNK-896 babe 
 of day . no UNK-27 . name and memory UNK-953 thee not . that UNK-405 
 UNK-995 of thy strength was taken from UNK-625 in UNK-398 . no son of thy 
 UNK-577 is by thee . there is none now to be for UNK-27 what UNK-27 was 
 for UNK-364 . 
 UNK-0 
 the voices blend and UNK-428 in UNK-298 silence silence that is the 
 infinite of space and UNK-171 UNK-173 the soul is UNK-478 over regions

 francis was UNK-757 stephen of years before when they had been at 
 school together in UNK-147 time . he asked about UNK-318 UNK-536 
 UNK-74 . where were they now ? neither knew . you have spoken of the 
 past and its UNK-683 stephen said . why think of them ? if i call them 
 into life across the waters of UNK-697 will not the poor UNK-738 UNK-480 to 
 my call ? who UNK-610 it ? i UNK-412 UNK-259 UNK-847 
 UNK-358 am lord and UNK-599 of their life . he UNK-317 his UNK-530 hair 
 with a UNK-811 of UNK-831 UNK-21 at vincent . that answer and those 
 leaves vincent said to him will UNK-66 you more UNK-827 when something 
 more and greatly more than a UNK-790 of light UNK-841 can call your genius 
 father . all who wish you well hope this for you . all desire to see 
 you bring forth the work you UNK-807 to UNK-931 you UNK-517 . i 
 UNK-496 wish you may not fail them . o no vincent UNK-10 said UNK-889 
 a hand on the shoulder near him . have no fear . he could not leave his 
 mother an UNK-313 . the young UNK-54 face grew dark . all could see how hard 
 it was for him to be UNK-610 of his promise and of his recent loss . he 
 would have UNK-275 from the UNK-555 had not the noise of voices UNK-567 
 the smart . UNK-501 had lost five UNK-822 on UNK-506 for a UNK-114 of the 
 riders name UNK-10 as much more . he told them of the race . the flag 
 fell and UNK-853 ! off UNK-649 the UNK-488 ran out UNK-540 with UNK-513 . UNK-501 
 up . she was leading the field . all hearts were UNK-570 . even UNK-31 
 could not contain herself . she UNK-234 her UNK-700 and UNK-5 UNK-622 ! 
 UNK-506 wins ! but in the straight on the run home when all were in close 
 order the dark horse UNK-458 drew level reached UNK-300 her . all 
 was lost now . UNK-31 was silent her eyes were sad UNK-212 . UNK-589 she 
 UNK-5 i am UNK-882 . but her lover UNK-550 her and brought her a bright 
 UNK-707 of gold in which lay some oval UNK-195 which she UNK-764 . a 
 tear fell one only . a UNK-127 fine UNK-422 said UNK-10 is w . lane . 
 four winners yesterday and three today . what rider is like him ? mount 
 him on the camel or the UNK-697 buffalo the victory in a hack UNK-359 
 is still his . but let us bear it as was the ancient UNK-19 . mercy on the 
 UNK-155 ! poor UNK-506 ! he said with a light UNK-317 . she is not the UNK-971 
 that she was . never by this hand shall we UNK-972 such another . by UNK-547 
 sir a queen of them . do you remember her vincent ? i wish you could 
 have seen my queen today vincent said . how young she was and UNK-543 
 UNK-664 were UNK-268 fair beside her in her yellow shoes and UNK-117 of 
 UNK-769 i do not know the right name of it . the UNK-584 that UNK-920 
 us were in bloom the air UNK-473 with their UNK-942 UNK-143 and with 
 UNK-481 floating by us . in the sunny patches one might easily have 
 cooked on a stone a batch of those UNK-236 with UNK-921 fruit in them that 
 UNK-418 sells in his booth near the bridge . but she had UNK-527 
 for her teeth but the arm with which i held her and in that she UNK-525 
 UNK-522 when i pressed too close . a week ago she lay ill four 
 days on the UNK-447 but today she was free UNK-327 UNK-941 at UNK-711 . 
 she is more taking then . her UNK-501 tool mad UNK-332 that she is she had 
 pulled her fill as we UNK-387 together . and in your ear my friend you 
 will not think who met us as we left the field . UNK-29 himself ! he was 
 walking by the UNK-722 reading i think a UNK-120 book with i doubt not 
 a UNK-130 letter in it from UNK-362 or UNK-120 to keep the page . the sweet 
 creature turned all colours in her confusion UNK-945 to UNK-226 a 
 slight disorder in her dress a slip of UNK-762 UNK-824 there for the 
 very trees UNK-648 her . when UNK-29 had passed she UNK-75 at her lovely 
 echo in that little mirror she carries . but he had been kind . in going 
 by he had blessed us . the gods too are ever kind UNK-10 said . if i had 
 poor luck with UNK-702 UNK-488 perhaps this UNK-643 of his may serve me more 
 UNK-867 . he was UNK-889 his hand upon a UNK-72 UNK-226 saw it and 
 UNK-454 his act pointing to the stranger and to the UNK-205 label . 
 UNK-252 UNK-226 UNK-222 preserve a UNK-616 silence . his soul is far 
 away . it is as painful perhaps to be UNK-329 from a vision as to be 
 born . any object UNK-112 regarded may be a gate of access to the 
 UNK-940 UNK-861 of the gods . do you not think it stephen ? UNK-951 
 told me so stephen answered whom in a previous existence egyptian 
 UNK-73 initiated into the UNK-442 of UNK-488 law . the UNK-153 of the 
 moon UNK-951 told me an UNK-873 UNK-741 from planet alpha 
 of the UNK-766 chain would not assume the UNK-640 UNK-247 and these 
 were therefore UNK-995 by the UNK-712 UNK-258 from the second 
 UNK-221 . 
 UNK-0 
 however as a matter of fact though the UNK-701 UNK-579 about him 
 being in some description of a UNK-250 or other or UNK-223 which 
 was entirely due to a UNK-995 of the UNK-631 character was 
 not the case at all . the individual whose visual UNK-328 while the above 
 was going on were at this UNK-563 UNK-268 to exhibit symptoms of 
 animation was as UNK-237 if not UNK-741 than any man living and anybody 
 that UNK-814 the contrary would have found themselves pretty 
 UNK-564 in the wrong shop . during the past four minutes or UNK-770 
 he had been UNK-151 hard at a certain amount of number one bass UNK-664 
 by UNK-428 bass and co at UNK-703 which happened to be situated 
 amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was 
 certainly calculated to attract UNK-432 remark on account of its 
 UNK-205 appearance . he was simply and solely as it subsequently 
 UNK-744 for reasons best known to himself which put quite an 
 UNK-537 different UNK-691 on the proceedings after the moment 
 UNK-298 observations about UNK-492 days and the UNK-474 UNK-433 two 
 or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as 
 UNK-606 innocent of as the babe UNK-543 . eventually however both 
 their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was 
 UNK-932 to help himself to the thing he UNK-594 determined 
 to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the 
 UNK-528 glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and 
 made a UNK-900 hole in it by UNK-821 a lot of it out with also at the 
 same time however a considerable degree of UNK-803 in order not 
 to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place . 
 UNK-0 
 the debate which UNK-397 was in its scope and progress an UNK-747 of the 
 course of life . neither place nor council was UNK-340 in UNK-491 . the 
 UNK-656 were the UNK-233 in the land the theme they were engaged on 
 the UNK-461 and most vital . the high hall of UNK-81 house had never 
 UNK-809 an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the 
 old UNK-699 of that establishment ever UNK-126 to a language so 
 UNK-148 . a UNK-995 scene in truth it made . UNK-877 was there at 
 the foot of the table in his striking highland UNK-157 his face UNK-808 
 from the UNK-610 UNK-883 of the UNK-564 of UNK-922 . there too opposite to him 
 was UNK-15 whose UNK-990 UNK-135 already the UNK-817 of early UNK-582 
 and UNK-593 wisdom . next the UNK-307 was the place assigned to 
 UNK-509 the UNK-580 while at his side was UNK-154 in UNK-30 UNK-835 
 the UNK-737 form of UNK-501 . the chair of the resident indeed stood UNK-841 
 before the UNK-679 but on either UNK-474 of it the figure of UNK-129 in 
 UNK-154 kit of UNK-216 shorts and UNK-134 UNK-5 UNK-566 UNK-408 
 UNK-278 with the UNK-837 UNK-916 and UNK-704 UNK-347 of UNK-226 
 roland st john UNK-4 . UNK-685 at the head of the board was the young 
 poet who found a UNK-324 from his UNK-32 of UNK-378 and UNK-466 
 UNK-129 in the UNK-626 atmosphere of UNK-672 discussion while 
 to right and left of him were UNK-112 the UNK-962 UNK-536 
 fresh from the UNK-379 and that UNK-521 UNK-174 UNK-799 by the 
 dust of travel and combat and UNK-567 by the UNK-417 of an UNK-173 
 UNK-181 but from whose UNK-968 and constant heart no UNK-38 or UNK-711 
 or threat or UNK-174 could ever UNK-126 the image of that UNK-788 
 UNK-912 which the inspired pencil of lafayette has UNK-856 for ages 
 yet to come . 
 UNK-0 
 it had better be stated here and now at the UNK-90 that the UNK-353 
 UNK-150 to which mr s . UNK-1 div . UNK-63 . UNK-259 
 would appear to prove him pretty badly UNK-672 runs directly counter to 
 accepted scientific methods . science it UNK-216 be too often repeated 
 deals with UNK-600 UNK-219 . the man of science like the man in the 
 street has to face UNK-902 facts that UNK-216 be UNK-713 and explain 
 them as best he can . there may be it is true some questions which 
 science UNK-216 UNK-228 UNK-329 as the first problem submitted 
 by mr l . bloom UNK-632 . UNK-543 . regarding the future determination of sex . 
 must we accept the view of UNK-252 of UNK-654 that the right UNK-715 
 the UNK-796 period UNK-411 others is responsible for the birth 
 of males or are the too long UNK-377 UNK-989 or UNK-203 the 
 UNK-869 factors or is it as most UNK-281 UNK-284 to 
 UNK-642 such as UNK-741 UNK-280 UNK-243 UNK-970 UNK-117 
 UNK-27 and UNK-148 a mixture of both ? this would be UNK-337 to 
 a cooperation one of UNK-978 favourite devices between the UNK-931 
 UNK-673 of the UNK-962 on the one hand and on the other a UNK-844 
 chosen position UNK-489 UNK-110 of the passive element . the other 
 problem raised by the same UNK-698 is UNK-253 less vital infant 
 mortality . it is interesting because as he UNK-376 remarks we 
 are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways . mr m . 
 UNK-4 UNK-648 . et UNK-476 . doc . UNK-113 the UNK-75 conditions in which 
 our UNK-995 citizens contract UNK-273 UNK-358 complaints etc . by 
 UNK-369 the bacteria which UNK-894 in dust . these factors he alleged 
 and the UNK-815 UNK-815 offered by our streets UNK-455 publicity 
 posters religious ministers of all UNK-395 UNK-118 soldiers 
 and UNK-2 exposed UNK-406 UNK-81 the suspended UNK-938 of 
 dead animals UNK-610 UNK-816 and UNK-732 UNK-534 he 
 said were UNK-853 for any and every UNK-68 in the UNK-2 of 
 the race . UNK-322 he UNK-275 would soon be generally adopted 
 and all the UNK-799 of life UNK-975 good music UNK-768 literature 
 light philosophy UNK-351 pictures UNK-957 UNK-84 of 
 the classical UNK-848 such as UNK-447 and apollo artistic UNK-332 
 photographs of prize babies all these little UNK-11 would enable 
 ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the UNK-661 months 
 in a most UNK-500 manner . mr j . UNK-877 disc . UNK-216 . attributes 
 some of these UNK-822 to UNK-235 trauma in the case of women workers 
 UNK-833 to heavy UNK-32 in the workshop and to UNK-261 discipline in 
 the home but by far the vast majority to UNK-546 private or official 
 UNK-814 in the exposure of UNK-222 infants the practice of criminal 
 abortion or in the UNK-634 crime of UNK-825 . although the former 
 we are thinking of UNK-546 is UNK-590 only too true the case he 
 UNK-176 of nurses UNK-779 to count the UNK-649 in the UNK-859 UNK-523 
 is too rare to be UNK-640 . in fact when one comes to look into it the 
 wonder is that so many UNK-36 and UNK-750 go off so well as they 
 do all things considered and in UNK-300 of our human UNK-593 which 
 often UNK-459 nature in her UNK-310 . an UNK-389 suggestion is 
 that thrown out by mr v . UNK-15 UNK-216 . UNK-891 . that both UNK-577 and 
 mortality as well as all other UNK-219 of evolution UNK-766 movements 
 UNK-766 phases blood temperatures diseases in general everything in 
 fine in UNK-978 vast workshop from the UNK-326 of some remote sun 
 to the UNK-30 of one of the UNK-910 flowers which UNK-728 our 
 public parks is subject to a law of UNK-193 as yet UNK-33 . 
 still the plain UNK-110 question why a child of normally healthy 
 parents and UNK-98 a healthy child and properly looked after UNK-380 
 UNK-407 in early childhood though other children of the same 
 marriage do not must certainly in the UNK-485 words give us UNK-242 . 
 nature we may rest assured has her own good and UNK-188 reasons for 
 whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law 
 of UNK-591 by which organisms in which UNK-27 UNK-164 have taken 
 up their residence modern science has UNK-52 shown that only the 
 UNK-262 substance can be said to be UNK-605 tend to UNK-135 at an 
 increasingly earlier stage of development an arrangement which though 
 productive of pain to some of our feelings UNK-649 the UNK-562 is

 race in general in UNK-632 thereby the survival of the UNK-62 . mr s .

 that an UNK-76 being which can UNK-239 UNK-720 digest and 
 apparently pass through the ordinary channel with UNK-485 
 UNK-390 such UNK-737 UNK-70 as UNK-117 females 
 UNK-425 by UNK-651 UNK-699 professional UNK-32 not to speak

 for the UNK-979 of those who are not so UNK-576 UNK-265 with 
 the UNK-270 of the municipal UNK-329 as this UNK-592 UNK-7 and 
 UNK-424 UNK-499 who for all his UNK-435 UNK-827 in things 
 scientific can UNK-253 UNK-733 an acid from an UNK-508 UNK-899 
 himself on being it should perhaps be stated that UNK-141 bob in 
 the UNK-200 UNK-315 of our UNK-748 licensed UNK-93 UNK-658 the 
 UNK-131 and UNK-710 flesh of a UNK-992 newly dropped from its mother . in 
 a recent public controversy with mr l . bloom UNK-632 . UNK-543 . which took 
 place in the commons hall of the national maternity hospital UNK-753 UNK-202 
 and UNK-163 UNK-305 street of which as is well known dr a . UNK-140 UNK-622 . in 
 UNK-313 . f . k . q . c . p . i . is the able and popular master he is reported 
 by UNK-560 as having stated that once a woman has let the cat 
 into the bag an UNK-295 UNK-858 UNK-460 to one of the most 
 complicated and UNK-902 of all UNK-978 UNK-188 act of sexual 
 congress she must let it out again or give it life as he UNK-424 it 
 to save her own . at the risk of her own was the telling UNK-930 of 
 his UNK-636 none the less effective for the moderate and measured 
 tone in which it was delivered .

 meanwhile the skill and UNK-435 of the physician had brought about a 
 happy UNK-729 . it had been a UNK-129 weary while both for patient 
 and doctor . all that surgical skill could do was done and the brave 
 woman had UNK-428 helped . she had . she had fought the good fight and 
 now she was very very happy . those who have passed on who have gone 
 before are happy too as they UNK-49 down and smile upon the UNK-358 
 scene . UNK-282 look at her as she UNK-73 there with the UNK-47 
 in her eyes that UNK-868 hunger for baby fingers a pretty sight it is 
 to see in the first bloom of her new UNK-158 breathing a silent 
 prayer of thanksgiving to one above the universal husband . and as her 
 loving eyes UNK-972 her babe she wishes only one UNK-697 more to have 
 her dear UNK-498 there with her to share her joy to lay in his arms that 
 UNK-266 of gods clay the fruit of their UNK-981 UNK-950 . he is older now 
 you and i may UNK-365 it and a UNK-442 UNK-109 in the UNK-61 yet 
 in the UNK-66 of years a grave UNK-491 has come to the UNK-548 
 second UNK-829 of the UNK-174 bank college green branch . o UNK-498 
 loved one of old UNK-620 UNK-179 now it may never be again that 
 UNK-627 time of the roses ! with the old shake of her pretty head she 
 UNK-608 those days . god ! how beautiful now across the UNK-688 of years ! but 
 their children are UNK-425 in her imagination about the UNK-453 UNK-349 
 and his UNK-847 mary alice frederick albert if he had lived UNK-231 
 UNK-456 victoria UNK-496 tom UNK-339 UNK-25 UNK-68 UNK-285 little 
 UNK-997 called after our famous hero of the south african war lord UNK-292 
 of UNK-471 and UNK-827 and now this last pledge of their union a 
 UNK-342 if ever there was one with the true UNK-342 nose . young UNK-367 
 will be UNK-910 UNK-172 edward after the UNK-902 third UNK-664 of 
 mr UNK-342 in the treasury UNK-972 office dublin castle . and so 
 time UNK-176 on but father UNK-296 has dealt UNK-79 here . no let no UNK-317 
 break from that UNK-186 dear gentle UNK-312 . and UNK-498 knock the UNK-460 from 
 your pipe the UNK-224 UNK-460 you still fancy when the UNK-538 rings for 
 you may it be the distant day ! and UNK-112 the light UNK-217 you read 
 in the sacred book for the oil too has run low and so with a UNK-263 
 heart to bed to rest . he knows and will call in his own good time . you 
 too have fought the good fight and played UNK-805 your UNK-54 part . sir 
 to you my hand . well done thou good and UNK-620 UNK-363 ! 
 UNK-0 
 there are UNK-104 or let us call them as the world calls them evil 
 memories which are hidden away by man in the UNK-7 places of the heart 
 but they UNK-767 there and wait . he may suffer their memory to grow dim 
 let them be as though they had not been and all but UNK-119 himself 
 that they were not or at least were otherwise . yet a chance word will 
 call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to UNK-92 him in the 
 most various circumstances a vision or a dream or while UNK-572 
 and UNK-31 UNK-894 his UNK-344 or UNK-22 the cool silver UNK-505 of the 
 evening or at the UNK-555 at midnight when he is now filled with wine . 
 not to UNK-651 over him will the vision come as over one that lies under 
 her UNK-880 not for UNK-183 to cut him off from the living but UNK-629 
 in the UNK-660 UNK-585 of the past silent remote UNK-664 .

 the stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow UNK-527 of 
 that false calm there imposed as it seemed by UNK-158 or some studied 
 trick upon words so UNK-321 as to UNK-63 in their speaker an 
 UNK-553 a UNK-460 for the UNK-324 things of life . a scene 
 UNK-577 itself in the UNK-859 memory UNK-685 it would seem by 
 a word of so natural a UNK-379 as if those days were really present 
 there as some thought with their immediate UNK-744 . a UNK-679 space 
 of lawn one soft may evening the UNK-503 grove of UNK-462 at 
 UNK-531 purple and white UNK-23 UNK-293 UNK-9 of the game but 
 with much real interest in the UNK-676 as they run slowly forward over 
 the UNK-968 or UNK-835 and stop one by its fellow with a brief alert 
 shock . and UNK-997 about that grey UNK-371 where the water moves at times 
 in UNK-198 irrigation you saw another as UNK-23 UNK-562 UNK-490 
 UNK-156 tiny and their UNK-13 friend with i know not what of UNK-327 in 
 her pose then our lady of the UNK-232 a UNK-503 UNK-910 of them UNK-721 
 from an ear bringing out the foreign UNK-635 of the skin so UNK-930 
 against the cool UNK-452 fruit . a UNK-5 of four or five in UNK-46 
 UNK-594 but there will be UNK-897 in the UNK-320 UNK-679 when UNK-971 long 
 the UNK-85 are gathered and UNK-201 is standing on the UNK-371 secured by 
 that circle of UNK-175 UNK-345 hands . he UNK-986 a little just as this young 
 man does now with a perhaps too conscious UNK-786 of the danger but 
 must needs glance at UNK-975 towards where his mother watches from the 
 UNK-93 giving upon the UNK-374 with a UNK-90 shadow of UNK-131 
 or of UNK-91 UNK-901 UNK-604 in her glad look . 
 UNK-0 
 mark this UNK-199 and remember . the end comes suddenly . enter that 
 UNK-927 of birth where the UNK-239 are assembled and note their 
 faces . nothing as it seems there of UNK-307 or violent . UNK-676 of 
 custody rather UNK-711 their station in that house the UNK-521 
 watch of UNK-213 and of angels about a UNK-178 in UNK-583 of UNK-909 long 
 ago . but as before the lightning the UNK-818 UNK-326 heavy with 
 UNK-108 excess of moisture in UNK-672 UNK-152 UNK-326 UNK-603 
 UNK-505 earth and sky in one vast UNK-60 UNK-31 above UNK-557 field 
 and UNK-185 UNK-788 and UNK-399 growth of UNK-216 and UNK-252 till in an 
 instant a flash UNK-333 their centres and with the UNK-519 of the 
 thunder the UNK-859 UNK-108 its UNK-48 so and not otherwise was the 
 transformation violent and UNK-288 upon the UNK-652 of the

 UNK-0 
 silent UNK-198 alert he stands on guard his fingers at his lips 
 in the attitude of secret master . against the dark wall a figure appears 
 slowly a fairy boy of eleven a UNK-551 UNK-545 dressed in an 
 UNK-921 suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet holding a book 
 in his hand . he reads from right to left UNK-936 UNK-21 kissing the

 UNK-0 
 UNK-515 to anything else mr bloom UNK-30 off the greater bulk of 
 the UNK-854 and handed stephen the hat and UNK-194 and UNK-790 him up 
 generally in UNK-40 UNK-341 fashion which he very badly needed . his 
 UNK-8 mind was not exactly what you would call UNK-254 but a bit 
 UNK-334 and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink mr 
 bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of UNK-618 water 
 available for their UNK-398 let alone drinking purposes hit upon an 
 UNK-619 by suggesting off the reel the UNK-873 of the UNK-791 
 shelter as it was called hardly a UNK-269 away near butt bridge 
 where they might hit upon some UNK-208 in the shape of a milk and 
 UNK-435 or a mineral . but how to get there was the UNK-936 . for the UNK-239 he 
 was rather UNK-529 but UNK-581 as the duty UNK-722 UNK-756 upon him 
 to take some measures on the subject he UNK-959 suitable ways and means 
 during which stephen UNK-289 UNK-7 . so far as he could see he was 
 rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly UNK-920 
 to get a UNK-741 of some description which would answer in their 
 then condition both of them being e UNK-465 UNK-216 particularly stephen always 
 assuming that there was such a thing to be found . accordingly after a 
 few such UNK-410 as UNK-751 in UNK-300 of his having forgotten 
 to take up his rather UNK-814 UNK-185 after it had done UNK-941 
 service in the UNK-699 line they both walked together along beaver 
 street or more properly lane as far as the UNK-176 and the 
 UNK-589 UNK-998 atmosphere of the UNK-61 UNK-891 at the corner of 
 montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from UNK-969 
 UNK-39 into UNK-608 street round by the corner of dan UNK-390 . but 
 as he UNK-345 anticipated there was not a sign of a UNK-417 UNK-171 for 
 hire anywhere to be seen except a UNK-321 probably engaged by some 
 UNK-13 inside on the UNK-304 outside the north star hotel and there was 
 no UNK-84 of its UNK-519 a quarter of an inch when mr bloom who was 
 anything but a professional UNK-269 UNK-542 to UNK-732 it by UNK-410 
 a kind of a UNK-266 holding his arms UNK-859 over his head twice . 
 UNK-0 
 this was a UNK-957 but bringing common sense to bear on it UNK-307 
 there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it 
 which they accordingly did . so UNK-23 around by UNK-407 and the 
 signal house which they shortly reached they UNK-360 UNK-332 in the 
 direction of UNK-608 street railway UNK-299 mr bloom being UNK-791 
 by the UNK-194 that one of the back buttons of his UNK-48 had 
 to vary the UNK-132 UNK-87 gone the way of all buttons though 
 entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing he UNK-542 made 
 light of the UNK-582 . so as neither of them were particularly pressed 
 for time as it happened and the temperature UNK-882 since it 
 cleared up after the recent UNK-935 of UNK-329 UNK-540 they UNK-470 
 along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a 
 UNK-469 . as it so happened a dublin united UNK-694 UNK-624 UNK-753 
 happened to be returning and the elder man UNK-755 to his companion UNK-0 
 UNK-673 of the incident his own truly UNK-723 escape of some little 
 while back . they passed the main entrance of the great northern railway 
 station the starting point for belfast where of course all traffic was 
 suspended at that late hour and passing the UNK-364 of the UNK-361 
 a not very UNK-982 UNK-681 not to say UNK-744 to a degree more 
 especially at night ultimately gained the dock UNK-54 and in due course 
 turned into store street famous for its c division police station . 
 between this point and the high at present UNK-698 UNK-113 of UNK-912 
 place stephen thought to think of UNK-637 associated with UNK-662 the 
 UNK-406 in his mind somehow in UNK-548 place first turning on the 
 right while the other who was acting as his UNK-929 UNK-711 UNK-520 
 with internal satisfaction the smell of james UNK-749 city UNK-321 
 situated quite close to where they were the very UNK-66 UNK-143 indeed 
 of our daily bread of all commodities of the public the primary and 
 most UNK-548 . bread the staff of life earn your bread o tell me 
 where is fancy bread at UNK-749 the UNK-329 it is said . 
 UNK-0 
 en route to his UNK-261 and not to put too fine a point on it not 
 yet perfectly UNK-357 companion mr bloom who at all events was in complete 
 possession of his UNK-538 never more so in fact UNK-407 UNK-357 
 spoke a word of caution re the UNK-519 of UNK-352 women of ill fame 
 and UNK-696 UNK-41 which barely UNK-707 once in a while though not 
 as a UNK-999 practice was of the nature of a regular UNK-937 for 
 young UNK-13 of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking 
 habits under the influence of UNK-246 unless you knew a little UNK-253 
 for every UNK-119 as even a fellow on the broad of his back could 
 UNK-249 a nasty kick if you UNK-3 look out . highly UNK-458 
 was the appearance on the scene of UNK-82 UNK-87 when stephen was 
 UNK-507 UNK-225 but for that man in the gap turning up at the 
 UNK-28 hour the UNK-349 might have been that he might have been a 
 candidate for the accident ward or failing that the UNK-673 and 
 an appearance in the court next day before mr UNK-282 or he being the 
 UNK-698 rather old wall he meant to say or UNK-302 which simply 
 UNK-43 UNK-625 for a UNK-26 when it got UNK-552 about . the reason he mentioned 
 the fact was that a lot of those UNK-695 whom he UNK-698 UNK-376 
 were UNK-556 UNK-301 in the service of the crown and as mr 
 bloom put it UNK-371 a case or two in the a division in UNK-839 
 street prepared to UNK-425 a hole through a ten UNK-93 pot . never on 
 the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city UNK-81 road for 
 example the 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-586 of the law were well in evidence the obvious reason being 
 they were paid to protect the upper classes . another thing he commented 
 on was UNK-648 soldiers with UNK-790 or UNK-739 of any description 
 liable to go off at any time which was UNK-337 to UNK-929 them 
 against UNK-775 should by any chance they fall out over anything . you 
 UNK-870 away your time he very UNK-220 maintained and health and 
 also character besides which the UNK-56 of the thing fast women 
 of the UNK-921 ran away with a lot of l s . d . into the bargain and 
 the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though UNK-358 
 the much UNK-849 question of UNK-229 he UNK-67 a glass of choice old 
 wine in season as both 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-467 and UNK-520 and UNK-9 UNK-500 UNK-51 UNK-649 a 
 good UNK-901 which he was a UNK-497 UNK-563 in still never beyond 
 a certain point where he UNK-327 drew the line as it simply led to 
 trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of 
 others UNK-82 . most of all he commented UNK-848 on the UNK-268 
 of stephen by all his UNK-192 UNK-11 but one a most UNK-474 
 piece of UNK-170 on the part of his brother UNK-564 under all the UNK-933 . 
 UNK-0 
 and that one was UNK-391 stephen said who up to then had said nothing 
 UNK-303 of any kind . 
 UNK-0 
 discussing these and UNK-427 topics they made a UNK-552 across the back 
 of the UNK-608 and passed under the loop line bridge where a UNK-59 
 of UNK-204 burning in front of a UNK-795 or something like one UNK-57 
 their rather UNK-232 UNK-981 . stephen of his own UNK-882 stopped for 
 no special reason to look at the UNK-930 of UNK-239 UNK-529 and by 
 the light UNK-940 from the UNK-59 he could just make out the UNK-13 
 figure of the corporation UNK-8 inside the UNK-286 of the UNK-795 . he 
 began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having 
 happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered 
 that he recognised in the UNK-915 a UNK-747 friend of his fathers 
 UNK-446 . to avoid a meeting he drew UNK-221 to the UNK-552 of the railway 
 bridge . 
 UNK-0 
 someone UNK-276 you mr bloom said . 
 UNK-0 
 a figure of middle height on the UNK-827 UNK-307 under the UNK-535 
 UNK-276 again calling 
 UNK-0 
 night ! 
 UNK-0 
 stephen of course started rather UNK-364 and stopped to return the 
 UNK-805 . mr bloom UNK-126 by UNK-535 of UNK-594 UNK-125 UNK-581 
 as he always believed in UNK-641 his own business moved off but 
 nevertheless remained on the qui UNK-324 with just a shade of anxiety 
 though not UNK-985 in the least . though unusual in the dublin area he 
 knew that it was not by any means unknown for UNK-236 who had next 
 to nothing to live on to be abroad UNK-222 and generally UNK-519 
 UNK-682 UNK-657 by placing a UNK-594 at their head in some 
 UNK-544 spot outside the city proper UNK-370 UNK-779 of the 
 UNK-418 UNK-154 category they might be hanging about there or simply 
 UNK-771 ready to UNK-927 with whatever UNK-749 they could in one fell 
 UNK-41 at a moments notice your money or your life leaving you there 
 to point a moral UNK-102 and UNK-225 . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen that is when the UNK-332 figure came to close quarters 
 though he was not in an over UNK-357 state himself recognised UNK-263 
 breath UNK-275 of UNK-833 UNK-860 . lord john UNK-62 some called him 
 and his genealogy came about in this wise . he was the UNK-904 son of 
 inspector UNK-62 of the g division lately UNK-396 who had married 
 a certain UNK-289 UNK-202 the daughter of a UNK-685 farmer . his 
 UNK-423 patrick michael UNK-62 of new ross had married the UNK-265 
 of a UNK-317 there whose maiden name had been UNK-289 also UNK-548 . 
 UNK-390 had it though not proved that she UNK-244 from the house of 
 the UNK-153 UNK-548 de UNK-684 in whose UNK-229 really an UNK-753 
 fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing her mother or UNK-7 or 
 some relative a woman as the tale went of extreme beauty had enjoyed 
 the distinction of being in service in the UNK-898 . this therefore 
 was the reason why the still UNK-156 young though UNK-558 
 man who now addressed stephen was spoken of by some with UNK-676 
 UNK-416 as lord john UNK-62 . 
 UNK-0 
 taking stephen on one side he had the UNK-206 UNK-199 UNK-930 to tell . 
 not as much as a UNK-407 to purchase a nights UNK-671 . his friends 
 had all UNK-761 him . furthermore he had a row with UNK-10 and called 
 him to stephen a mean bloody UNK-545 with a UNK-356 of a number of other 
 UNK-861 expressions . he was out of a job and UNK-309 of stephen to 
 tell him where on gods earth he could get something anything at all 
 to do . no it was the daughter of the mother in the UNK-898 that 
 was UNK-317 to the UNK-759 of the house or else they were connected 
 through the mother in some way both UNK-625 happening at the same 
 time if the whole thing UNK-69 a complete UNK-668 from start to 
 finish . UNK-58 he was all in . 
 UNK-0 
 i UNK-9 ask you only UNK-618 he on my UNK-384 UNK-19 and god knows 
 im on the rocks . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-63 be a job tomorrow or next day stephen told him in a boys 
 school at UNK-54 for a gentleman UNK-230 . mr UNK-741 UNK-108 . try it . you 
 may mention my name . 
 UNK-0 
 ah god UNK-62 replied sure i UNK-18 teach in a school man . i was 
 never one of your bright ones he added with a half laugh . i got stuck 
 twice in the junior at the christian brothers . 
 UNK-0 
 i have no place to sleep myself stephen informed him . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-62 at the first UNK-236 was UNK-444 to suspect it was something to 
 do with stephen being fired out of his UNK-567 for bringing in a bloody 
 UNK-114 off the street . there was a UNK-791 in UNK-657 street mrs 
 UNK-251 but it was only a UNK-586 touch and full of UNK-305 but 
 UNK-26 told him you got a decent enough do in the UNK-271 head over 
 in UNK-88 street which was UNK-558 UNK-824 to the person 
 addressed of UNK-537 bacon for a bob . he was UNK-266 too though he 
 UNK-180 said a word about it . 
 UNK-0 
 though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it 
 still UNK-8 feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew 
 that UNK-263 UNK-930 UNK-819 on a par with the others was hardly 
 UNK-603 of much UNK-589 . however UNK-262 UNK-288 UNK-340 UNK-916 
 UNK-245 disco UNK-255 as the latin poet remarks especially as luck 
 would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on 
 the UNK-745 which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though 
 a good bit of the UNK-800 was UNK-71 . but the cream of the joke 
 was nothing would get it out of UNK-263 head that he was living in 
 UNK-720 and UNK-180 a thing to do but hand out the UNK-956 . whereas . 
 he put his hand in a pocket UNK-58 not with the idea of finding any food 
 there but thinking he might UNK-545 him anything up to a bob or so in UNK-975 
 so that he might UNK-290 at all events and get sufficient to eat but 
 the result was in the negative for to his UNK-170 he found his cash 
 missing . a few broken UNK-140 were all the result of his investigation . 
 he tried his UNK-477 to UNK-633 for the moment whether he had lost 
 as well he might have or left because in that UNK-119 it was not a 
 pleasant UNK-369 very much the reverse in fact . he was UNK-537 too 
 UNK-986 out to institute a thorough search though he tried to UNK-633 . 
 about UNK-140 he UNK-815 remembered . who now exactly gave them he 
 UNK-105 or where was or did he buy . however in another pocket he came 
 across what he UNK-310 in the dark were UNK-16 UNK-718 however 
 as it turned out . 
 UNK-0 
 those are UNK-924 man UNK-62 corrected him . 
 UNK-0 
 and so in point of fact they turned out to be . stephen UNK-58 UNK-256 him 
 one of them . 
 UNK-0 
 thanks UNK-62 answered UNK-14 a gentleman . ill pay you back one 
 time . UNK-169 that with you ? i saw him a few times in the bleeding horse 
 in UNK-223 street with UNK-43 the UNK-580 . you might put in a good 
 word for us to get me taken on there . id carry a UNK-802 only 
 the girl in the office told me UNK-30 full up for the next three weeks 
 man . god UNK-628 to book ahead man UNK-306 think it was for the carl 
 rosa . i dont give a UNK-530 anyway so long as i get a job even as a 
 crossing UNK-787 . 
 UNK-0 
 subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six 
 he got he informed stephen about a fellow by the name of bags UNK-869 
 that he said stephen knew well out of UNK-194 the UNK-903 
 UNK-433 there that used to be often round in UNK-343 back with UNK-370 
 and a little UNK-26 with a UNK-615 the name of UNK-766 . UNK-58 he was UNK-294 
 the night before last and UNK-701 ten bob for a drunk and UNK-259 and 
 UNK-466 to go with the UNK-233 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-98 
 UNK-0 
 mr bloom in the meanwhile kept UNK-625 about in the UNK-781 of the 
 UNK-529 near the UNK-59 of UNK-204 in front of the corporation 
 UNK-578 UNK-795 who UNK-307 a UNK-817 for work it struck him 
 was having a quiet forty UNK-203 for all UNK-409 and purposes on his own 
 private account while dublin UNK-613 . he UNK-163 an odd eye at the same time 
 now and then at UNK-8 anything but UNK-131 UNK-511 UNK-636 
 as if he had seen that UNK-135 somewhere or other though where he was 
 not in a position to UNK-460 state nor had he the UNK-368 idea when . 
 being a UNK-244 individual who could give points to not a few in 
 point of UNK-295 observation he also UNK-957 on his very UNK-607 
 hat and UNK-701 wearing apparel generally UNK-574 to a chronic 
 UNK-467 . UNK-840 he was one of his UNK-179 but for the 
 matter of that it was merely a question of one UNK-556 on his UNK-178 
 UNK-379 all round in every deep so to put it a deeper depth and for 
 the matter of that if the man in the street UNK-726 to be in the dock 
 himself UNK-546 UNK-665 with or without the option of a fine would be 
 a very UNK-303 UNK-772 UNK-537 . in any case he had a UNK-658 amount of 
 cool assurance UNK-53 people at that hour of the night or morning . 
 pretty thick that was certainly . 
 UNK-0 
 the pair UNK-621 company and stephen UNK-371 mr bloom who with his 
 UNK-156 eye was not without UNK-491 that he had UNK-924 to the 
 UNK-610 of the other UNK-260 . UNK-777 to the encounter he said 
 UNK-321 stephen that is 
 UNK-0 
 he is down on his luck . he asked me to ask you to ask somebody named 
 UNK-43 a UNK-580 to give him a job as a UNK-432 . 
 UNK-0 
 at this intelligence in which he UNK-98 UNK-521 little interest mr 
 bloom UNK-84 UNK-151 for the space of a half a second or so in the 
 direction of a UNK-733 UNK-425 in the UNK-628 name of UNK-724 
 UNK-378 UNK-625 UNK-608 UNK-118 and quite possibly out of repair 
 UNK-65 he observed UNK-305 
 UNK-0 
 everybody gets their own UNK-61 of luck they say . now you mention it 
 his face was familiar to me . but leaving that for the moment how much 
 did you part with he UNK-426 if i am not too UNK-143 ? 
 UNK-0 
 half a crown stephen responded . i UNK-48 he needs it to sleep 
 somewhere . 
 UNK-0 
 needs ! mr bloom UNK-334 UNK-877 not the least surprise at 
 the intelligence i can quite credit the UNK-611 and i guarantee he 
 UNK-327 does . everyone according to his needs or everyone according 
 to his UNK-898 . but talking about things in general where added he with 
 a smile will you sleep yourself ? walking to UNK-884 is out of 
 the question . and even UNK-885 you did you UNK-19 get in after what 
 occurred at UNK-761 row station . simply UNK-233 out there for nothing . i 
 dont mean to UNK-824 to UNK-599 to you in the UNK-983 degree but why 
 did you leave your fathers house ? 
 UNK-0 
 to seek UNK-974 was UNK-8 answer . 
 UNK-0 
 i met your respected father on a recent occasion mr bloom 
 UNK-365 returned today in fact or to be strictly accurate on 
 yesterday . where does he live at present ? i gathered in the course of 
 conversation that he had moved . 
 UNK-0 
 i believe he is in dublin somewhere stephen answered UNK-6 . 
 why ? 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-836 man mr bloom said of mr UNK-1 senior in more UNK-640 
 than one and a born UNK-85 if ever there was one . he takes great 
 pride quite legitimate out of you . you could go back perhaps he 
 UNK-637 still thinking of the very UNK-144 scene at UNK-761 row 
 UNK-299 when it was perfectly evident that the other two UNK-4 
 that is and that english tourist friend of his who eventually UNK-977 
 their third companion were UNK-723 trying as if the whole UNK-485 
 station UNK-386 to them to give stephen the slip in the confusion 
 which they did . 
 UNK-0 
 there was no response UNK-652 to the suggestion however such as it 
 was UNK-8 minds eye being too UNK-796 engaged in UNK-739 his 
 family UNK-679 the last time he saw it with his sister UNK-353 sitting by 
 the UNK-261 her hair hanging down waiting for some weak trinidad shell 
 UNK-323 that was in the UNK-448 UNK-767 to be done so that she and he 
 could drink it with the UNK-861 for milk after the friday UNK-705 
 they had UNK-361 at two a penny with an egg UNK-891 for UNK-10 UNK-792 and 
 UNK-228 the cat meanwhile under the UNK-120 UNK-300 a mess of UNK-450 
 and UNK-184 fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper in 
 accordance with the third UNK-531 of the church to fast and UNK-559 
 on the days UNK-428 it being quarter UNK-134 or if not UNK-734 days or 
 something like that . 
 UNK-0 
 no mr bloom repeated again i UNK-9 personally UNK-835 much trust 
 in that UNK-263 companion of yours who UNK-171 the UNK-174 element dr 
 UNK-4 as a guide UNK-499 and friend if i were in your shoes . he 
 knows which side his bread is UNK-236 on though in all probability he 
 never UNK-142 what it is to be without regular meals . of course you 
 UNK-3 notice as much as i did . but it UNK-9 occasion me the least 
 surprise to learn that a UNK-429 of tobacco or some UNK-989 was put in 
 your drink for some UNK-118 object . 
 UNK-0 
 he understood however from all he heard that dr UNK-4 was a UNK-310 
 UNK-751 man by no means UNK-62 to medicine only who was rapidly 
 coming to the UNK-66 in his line and if the report was verified UNK-432 
 fair to enjoy a UNK-16 practice in the not too distant future as 
 a tony medical practitioner drawing a UNK-218 fee for his services 
 in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from 
 certain UNK-832 by artificial UNK-195 and what they call first 
 aid at UNK-497 or UNK-684 was it ? was he was bound to admit an 
 UNK-312 UNK-707 UNK-448 which he could not too highly praise so that 
 UNK-846 he was UNK-944 at a loss to UNK-851 what UNK-392 reason could be 
 at the back of it except he put it down to sheer UNK-392 or UNK-315 
 pure and simple . 
 UNK-0 
 except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking 
 your UNK-439 he UNK-625 to throw out . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-904 glance of half UNK-890 half UNK-148 UNK-928 by 
 UNK-99 which he gave at UNK-8 at present UNK-28 expression 
 of features did not throw a flood of light none at all in fact on the 
 problem as to whether he had let himself be badly UNK-765 to judge by 
 two or three UNK-77 remarks he let drop or the other way about saw 
 through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself 
 allowed matters to more or less . UNK-356 poverty did have that effect 
 and he more than UNK-814 that high educational abilities though he 
 UNK-845 he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet . 
 UNK-0 
 adjacent to the mens public UNK-107 they perceived an UNK-155 car round 
 which a group of UNK-460 UNK-597 in heated UNK-205 were getting 
 rid of UNK-288 expressions in their UNK-148 language in a particularly 
 animated way there being some little differences between the parties . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-753 madonna UNK-141 ci UNK-122 i UNK-240 ! ho UNK-163 ? UNK-242 UNK-177 ! 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-109 . UNK-616 UNK-739 UNK-341 . . . 
 UNK-0 
 dice UNK-0 UNK-899 ! 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-616 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-325 ! UNK-385 UNK-737 ! 
 UNK-0 
 ma UNK-882 ! UNK-217 la UNK-336 UNK-341 . . . 
 UNK-0 
 mr bloom and stephen entered the UNK-791 shelter an UNK-52 
 wooden structure where prior to then he had rarely if ever been 
 before the former having previously UNK-222 to the latter a few 
 hints UNK-15 the UNK-430 of it said to be the once famous UNK-78 
 UNK-421 the UNK-838 though he could not UNK-622 for the actual 
 facts which quite possibly there was not one UNK-463 of truth in . a few 
 moments later saw our two UNK-276 safely UNK-154 in a UNK-317 corner 
 only to be UNK-593 by UNK-926 from the UNK-837 miscellaneous collection 
 of UNK-300 and UNK-773 and other UNK-856 UNK-295 of the UNK-651 UNK-296 
 already there engaged in eating and drinking UNK-132 by conversation 
 for whom they UNK-98 formed an object of marked UNK-148 . 
 UNK-0 
 now UNK-358 a cup of coffee mr bloom UNK-625 to UNK-283 suggest 
 to break the ice it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the 
 shape of solid food say a roll of some description . 
 UNK-0 
 accordingly his first act was with characteristic UNK-31 to order 
 these commodities UNK-40 . the UNK-679 UNK-812 of UNK-91 or UNK-990 
 or whatever they were after a UNK-141 examination turned their eyes 
 apparently UNK-32 away though one UNK-913 UNK-959 individual 
 portion of whose hair was UNK-22 a UNK-99 probably still UNK-156 for 
 some UNK-6 time before UNK-495 his UNK-827 attention to the 
 floor . mr bloom UNK-322 himself of the right of free speech he having 
 just a UNK-694 UNK-930 with the language in dispute though to be 
 sure rather in a UNK-957 over UNK-136 UNK-957 to his UNK-825 in 
 an UNK-557 tone of voice a UNK-673 of the battle royal in the street 
 which was still UNK-668 fast and UNK-942 
 UNK-0 
 a beautiful language . i mean for singing purposes . why do you not 
 write your poetry in that language ? UNK-131 UNK-605 ! it is so UNK-952 
 and full . UNK-738 . UNK-136 . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen who was trying his dead best to UNK-83 if he could suffering 
 from UNK-372 generally replied 
 UNK-0 
 to fill the ear of a cow elephant . they were UNK-187 over money . 
 UNK-0 
 is that so ? mr bloom asked . of course he UNK-13 UNK-927 at the 
 UNK-362 reflection of there being more languages to start with than were 
 absolutely necessary it may be only the southern UNK-436 that UNK-390 
 it . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-430 of the shelter in the middle of this UNK-614 put a 
 UNK-365 swimming cup of a choice UNK-133 UNK-747 coffee on the table 
 and a rather UNK-316 UNK-540 of a UNK-944 or so it seemed . after 
 which he beat a retreat to his counter mr bloom determining to have 
 a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to . for which 
 reason he encouraged stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did 
 the UNK-42 by UNK-851 pushing the cup of what was temporarily 
 supposed to be called coffee gradually UNK-221 him . 
 UNK-0 
 sounds are UNK-744 stephen said after a UNK-242 of some little time 
 like names . UNK-932 UNK-602 . UNK-471 mr UNK-872 . jesus mr UNK-733 . 
 UNK-892 were as common as UNK-616 . whats in a name ? 
 UNK-0 
 yes to be sure mr bloom UNK-518 UNK-939 . of course . our name 
 was changed too he added pushing the UNK-348 roll across . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-913 UNK-99 who had his weather eye on the UNK-403 UNK-102 
 stephen whom he had UNK-655 out for attention in particular UNK-258 
 by asking 
 UNK-0 
 and what might your name be ? 
 UNK-0 
 just in the nick of time mr bloom touched his UNK-193 boot but 
 stephen apparently UNK-344 the warm pressure from an unexpected 
 quarter answered 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-1 . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-99 UNK-156 at him heavily from a pair of UNK-185 UNK-442 eyes 
 rather UNK-754 up from excessive use of UNK-118 UNK-82 good old 
 UNK-729 and water . 
 UNK-0 
 you know simon UNK-1 ? he asked at length . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-201 heard of him stephen said . 
 UNK-0 
 mr bloom was all at sea for a moment seeing the others UNK-307 
 UNK-273 too . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-2 irish the UNK-839 bold UNK-559 UNK-151 still in much the same 
 way and UNK-278 . all irish . 
 UNK-0 
 all too irish stephen UNK-371 . 
 UNK-0 
 as for mr bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business 
 and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the UNK-99 
 of his own UNK-882 turned to the other UNK-824 of the shelter with the 
 remark 
 UNK-0 
 i seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his 
 shoulder . the UNK-307 dead shot . 
 UNK-0 
 though he was slightly UNK-689 by an occasional UNK-761 and his 
 UNK-746 being also UNK-713 as it was still he did his best to explain . 
 UNK-0 
 bottles out there say . fifty yards measured . eggs on the bottles . 
 cocks his gun over his shoulder . aims . 
 UNK-0 
 he turned his body half round shut up his right eye completely . then he 
 UNK-960 his features up UNK-274 UNK-174 and UNK-969 out into the night 
 with an UNK-207 cast of UNK-990 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-18 ! he then UNK-247 once . 
 UNK-0 
 the entire audience UNK-56 UNK-525 an additional UNK-709 there 
 being still a further egg . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-18 ! he UNK-247 twice . 
 UNK-0 
 egg two UNK-307 UNK-71 he UNK-146 and UNK-743 adding 
 UNK-812 
 UNK-0 
 buffalo bill UNK-562 to kill never missed nor he never will . 
 UNK-0 
 a silence UNK-397 till mr bloom for UNK-111 sake just felt like 
 asking him whether it was for a UNK-115 competition like the 
 UNK-347 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-429 UNK-906 the UNK-99 said . 
 UNK-0 
 long ago ? mr bloom UNK-618 without UNK-503 a UNK-121 . 
 UNK-0 
 why the UNK-99 replied UNK-388 to a certain extent under the magic 
 influence of diamond cut diamond it might be a matter of ten years . he 
 UNK-190 the wide world with UNK-556 royal circus . i seen him do that in 
 stockholm . 
 UNK-0 
 curious UNK-780 mr bloom UNK-837 to stephen UNK-438 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-764 my name the UNK-99 continued . d . b . murphy of UNK-451 . 
 know where that is ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-74 harbour stephen replied . 
 UNK-0 
 thats right the UNK-99 said . fort UNK-223 and fort UNK-164 . thats 
 where i UNK-422 from . i belongs there . thats where i UNK-422 from . my 
 little UNK-95 down there . UNK-23 waiting for me i know . for england 
 home and beauty . UNK-23 my own true wife i UNK-204 seen for seven years 
 now sailing about . 
 UNK-0 
 mr bloom could easily picture his UNK-534 on this scene the UNK-966 
 to the UNK-80 UNK-942 UNK-588 after having UNK-0 UNK-188 jones 
 a UNK-726 night with a blind moon . across the world for a wife . quite a 
 number of stories there were on that particular alice ben bolt topic 
 UNK-135 UNK-734 and rip van UNK-906 and does anybody UNK-845 remember UNK-943 
 UNK-520 a favourite and most trying UNK-211 piece by the way of 
 poor john casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way . 
 never about the UNK-15 wife coming back however much devoted to the 
 UNK-330 . the face at the window ! judge of his UNK-944 when he 
 finally did breast the tape and the awful truth UNK-724 upon him UNK-15 
 his better half UNK-782 in his UNK-294 . you little expected me but 
 UNK-201 come to stay and make a fresh start . there she UNK-805 a UNK-962 
 at the UNK-595 UNK-583 . believes me dead UNK-270 in the cradle of the 
 deep . and there UNK-805 uncle UNK-224 or UNK-20 as the case might be the 
 UNK-317 of the crown and anchor in UNK-775 eating UNK-759 and

 her knee post UNK-664 child . with a high ro ! and a randy ro ! and my 
 UNK-608 UNK-375 UNK-234 o ! bow to the UNK-261 . UNK-205 and bear it . i 
 remain with much love your UNK-845 husband d b murphy . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-99 who UNK-253 seemed to be a dublin resident turned to one 
 of the UNK-91 with the request 
 UNK-0 
 you dont happen to have such a thing as a spare UNK-544 about you ? 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-469 addressed as it happened had not but the UNK-430 took a die of 
 plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was 
 passed from hand to hand . 
 UNK-0 
 thank you the UNK-99 said . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-518 the UNK-260 in his UNK-211 and UNK-574 and with some slow 
 UNK-655 UNK-360 
 UNK-0 
 we come up this morning eleven UNK-270 . the UNK-954 UNK-766 
 from UNK-539 with UNK-720 . i shipped to get over . paid off this 
 afternoon . UNK-6 my discharge . see ? d . b . murphy . a . b . s . 
 UNK-0 
 in confirmation of which statement he UNK-951 from an inside pocket 
 and handed to his UNK-379 a not very UNK-390 UNK-177 document . 
 UNK-0 
 you must have seen a fair share of the world the UNK-430 UNK-957 
 UNK-200 on the counter . 
 UNK-0 
 why the UNK-99 answered upon reflection upon it UNK-201 UNK-54 
 a bit since i first joined on . i was in the red sea . i was in china and 
 north america and south america . we was UNK-831 by pirates one UNK-787 .

 the UNK-757 under captain UNK-489 the best bloody man that ever 
 UNK-503 a ship . i seen russia . UNK-716 UNK-252 . thats how the 
 UNK-11 UNK-639 . 
 UNK-0 
 you seen UNK-81 UNK-460 dont be talking put in a UNK-469 . 
 UNK-0 
 why the UNK-99 said UNK-902 his partially UNK-24 plug . i seen 
 UNK-81 things too ups and UNK-709 . i seen a UNK-384 bite the UNK-810 of an 
 anchor same as i UNK-784 that UNK-260 . 
 UNK-0 
 he took out of his mouth the UNK-354 UNK-260 and lodging it between his 
 teeth bit UNK-488 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-357 ! like that . and i seen UNK-56 in peru that UNK-379 UNK-656 and 
 the UNK-62 of horses . look here . here they are . a friend of mine sent 
 me . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-148 out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to 
 be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table . the 
 printed matter on it stated UNK-204 de UNK-627 . UNK-743 bolivia . 
 UNK-0 
 all UNK-718 their attention at the scene UNK-592 a group of savage 
 women in UNK-44 UNK-693 UNK-202 UNK-717 UNK-523 UNK-449 
 sleeping UNK-22 a UNK-657 of infants there must have been quite a score of 
 them outside some UNK-902 UNK-252 of UNK-73 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-777 UNK-878 all day the UNK-197 UNK-985 added . UNK-607 
 like UNK-671 . cuts off their UNK-999 when they cant bear no more 
 children . 
 UNK-0 
 see them sitting there UNK-475 UNK-675 eating a dead horses liver 
 raw . 
 UNK-0 
 his postcard proved a centre of attraction for UNK-428 the UNK-646 for 
 several minutes if not more . 
 UNK-0 
 know how to keep them off ? he UNK-388 generally . 
 UNK-0 
 nobody UNK-544 a statement he UNK-743 saying 
 UNK-0

 mr bloom without UNK-21 surprise UNK-245 turned over the 
 card to UNK-937 the partially UNK-140 address and UNK-98 . it ran 
 as follows UNK-305 postal UNK-314 a UNK-52 UNK-872 UNK-984 UNK-74 
 chile . there was no message UNK-307 as he took particular notice . 
 though not an UNK-58 UNK-563 in the UNK-323 story UNK-283 or the 
 UNK-576 transaction for that matter despite william tell and the 
 UNK-920 UNK-246 de UNK-898 incident UNK-905 in UNK-267 on which 
 occasion the UNK-519 ball passed through the UNK-827 hat having 
 detected a UNK-757 between his name assuming he was the person 
 he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours 
 after having boxed the UNK-505 on the strict q UNK-731 . somewhere and 
 the UNK-255 UNK-249 of the UNK-94 which made him UNK-292 some 
 UNK-217 of our friends UNK-701 UNK-371 nevertheless it UNK-610 him in 
 a way of a UNK-736 plan he meant to one day UNK-950 some wednesday 
 or saturday of travelling to london via long sea not to say that he had 
 ever UNK-699 UNK-755 to any great extent but he was at heart a 
 born UNK-127 though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained 
 a UNK-213 except you call going to UNK-733 which was his longest . 
 martin UNK-11 frequently said he would work a pass through UNK-67 but 
 some UNK-464 UNK-178 or other UNK-682 UNK-295 up with the net result that 
 the scheme fell through . but even suppose it did come to UNK-247 
 down the UNK-956 and breaking UNK-181 heart it was not so dear purse 
 UNK-915 a few UNK-472 at the outside considering the fare to 
 UNK-812 where he figured on going was five and six there and back . 
 the trip would benefit health on account of the UNK-436 ozone and be in 
 every way thoroughly UNK-848 especially for a UNK-26 whose liver was 
 out of order seeing the different places along the route plymouth 
 UNK-86 southampton and so on UNK-814 in an UNK-351 tour of 
 the UNK-460 of the great UNK-26 the UNK-876 of our modern UNK-587 
 where UNK-398 he would see the greatest improvement tower UNK-497 
 wealth of park lane to renew UNK-930 with . another thing just 
 struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a UNK-49 around 
 on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert 
 tour of summer music UNK-430 the most prominent pleasure resorts 
 UNK-335 with mixed UNK-347 and UNK-431 UNK-15 and spas UNK-865 
 UNK-931 UNK-335 and so on beautiful UNK-644 the channel 
 islands and similar UNK-443 spots which might prove highly UNK-521 . 
 not of course with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies 
 on the job witness mrs c p UNK-37 type UNK-545 me your UNK-187 and ill post 
 you the ticket . no something top UNK-541 an all star irish UNK-641 the 
 UNK-335 grand opera company with his own legal UNK-188 as leading 
 lady as a sort of UNK-200 to the UNK-427 UNK-895 and UNK-762 
 perfectly simple matter and he was quite UNK-479 of success providing 
 UNK-575 in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of 
 UNK-569 who could pull the UNK-548 wires and thus combine business 
 with pleasure . but who ? that was the UNK-936 . also without being actually 
 positive it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line 
 of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times UNK-334 of the 
 UNK-395 route which it was UNK-202 was once more on the 
 UNK-409 in the UNK-323 departments with the usual quantity of red 
 tape and UNK-108 of UNK-572 UNK-333 and UNK-275 generally . a 
 great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet 
 the travelling needs of the public at large the average man i UNK-814 . 
 brown robinson and co . 
 UNK-0 
 it was a subject of UNK-675 and UNK-513 as well on the face of it and no 
 small blame to our UNK-866 society that the man in the street when the 
 system really needed UNK-312 up for the matter of a couple of UNK-487 
 pounds was UNK-527 from seeing more of the world they lived in instead 
 of being always and ever UNK-72 up since my old UNK-472 took me 
 for a wife . after all hang it they had their eleven and more UNK-341 
 months of it and UNK-270 a radical change of venue after the UNK-487 
 of city life in the UNK-530 for choice when dame nature is at her 
 spectacular best UNK-371 nothing short of a new lease of life . 
 there were equally excellent opportunities for UNK-287 in the home 
 island UNK-80 UNK-948 spots for UNK-523 offering a UNK-446 
 of attractions as well as a UNK-436 UNK-781 for the system in and around 
 dublin and its UNK-377 UNK-26 even UNK-695 to which there was 
 a UNK-475 but also UNK-199 away from the UNK-619 crowd in UNK-777 
 UNK-793 UNK-690 the garden of ireland an ideal UNK-501 for elderly 
 UNK-677 so long as it UNK-3 come down and in the UNK-211 of UNK-266 
 where if report spoke true the UNK-561 UNK-265 was UNK-312 grand 
 though the UNK-999 UNK-681 was not easily UNK-531 so that the 
 UNK-61 of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the 
 signal benefits to be derived from it while UNK-301 with its historic 
 associations and otherwise UNK-376 thomas grace UNK-195 george iv 
 UNK-779 several hundred feet above UNK-622 was a favourite UNK-926 
 with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young 
 mens fancy though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the 
 UNK-265 by design or UNK-787 usually by the way on their left 
 leg it being only about three quarters of an hours run from the 
 UNK-271 . because of course UNK-864 tourist travelling was as yet merely 
 in its UNK-340 so to speak and the accommodation left much to be 
 desired . interesting to UNK-851 it seemed to him from a UNK-701 of 
 UNK-148 pure and simple was whether it was the traffic that created 
 the route or UNK-719 or the two sides in fact . he turned back the 
 other side of the card picture and passed it along to stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 i seen a chinese one time related the UNK-661 UNK-646 that had 
 little pills like UNK-955 and he put them in the water and they opened and 
 every pill was something different . one was a ship another was a house 
 another was a flower . UNK-417 rats in your soup he UNK-103 added 
 the UNK-782 does . 
 UNK-0 
 possibly UNK-491 an expression of UNK-204 on their faces the 
 UNK-64 went on UNK-673 to his adventures . 
 UNK-0 
 and i seen a man killed in UNK-345 by an italian UNK-26 . knife in his 
 back . knife like that . 
 UNK-0 
 whilst speaking he produced a UNK-691 UNK-886 quite in 
 keeping with his character and held it in the striking position . 
 UNK-0 
 in a UNK-103 it was count of a UNK-804 between two UNK-811 . 
 fellow UNK-373 behind a door come up behind him . like that . prepare to 
 meet your god says he . UNK-57 ! it went into his back up to the butt . 
 UNK-0 
 his heavy glance UNK-37 UNK-765 about kind of UNK-268 their further 
 questions even should they by any chance want to . 
 UNK-0 
 thats a good bit of steel repeated he examining his UNK-935 
 UNK-904 . 
 UNK-0 
 after which UNK-361 UNK-779 sufficient to UNK-190 the UNK-461 he 
 UNK-310 the blade to and UNK-998 the weapon in question away as before in 
 his chamber of UNK-460 otherwise pocket . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-30 great for the cold steel somebody who was UNK-307 quite in 
 the dark said for the benefit of them all . that was why they thought 
 the park UNK-693 of the UNK-53 was done by UNK-80 on account of 
 them using knives . 
 UNK-0 
 at this remark passed obviously in the spirit of where UNK-678 
 is UNK-120 mr b . and stephen each in his own particular way both 
 UNK-186 UNK-45 meaning UNK-26 in a religious silence of the 
 strictly UNK-5 UNK-407 variety however towards where UNK-78 
 alias the UNK-430 not turning a hair was drawing UNK-790 of liquid 
 from his UNK-86 affair . his UNK-136 face which was really a work 
 of art a perfect study in itself UNK-377 description UNK-465 
 the impression that he UNK-3 understand one UNK-2 of what was going on . 
 funny very ! 
 UNK-0 
 there UNK-397 a somewhat UNK-480 UNK-242 . one man was reading in fits and 
 starts a UNK-567 by coffee evening journal another the card with the 
 UNK-241 UNK-204 de another the UNK-877 discharge . mr bloom so far 
 as he was personally concerned was just UNK-960 in UNK-382 mood . he 
 UNK-818 UNK-738 when the occurrence UNK-597 to took place as well 
 as yesterday roughly some score of years previously in the days of the 
 land UNK-117 when it took the UNK-159 world by storm UNK-290 
 speaking early in the UNK-933 UNK-905 to be correct when he was 
 just turned fifteen . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-42 boss the UNK-99 broke in . give us back them papers . 
 UNK-0 
 the request being UNK-580 with he UNK-77 them up with a UNK-890 . 
 UNK-0 
 have you seen the rock of gibraltar ? mr bloom UNK-388 . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-99 UNK-159 UNK-574 in a way that might be read as yes UNK-42 or 
 no . 
 UNK-0 
 ah UNK-628 touched there too mr bloom said UNK-904 point thinking he 
 had in the hope that the rover might possibly by some UNK-158 but 
 he failed to do so simply letting UNK-9 a jet of UNK-228 into the UNK-483 
 and UNK-35 his head with a sort of lazy UNK-589 . 
 UNK-0 
 what year would that be about ? mr b UNK-913 . can you recall the 
 boats ? 
 UNK-0 
 our UNK-962 UNK-99 UNK-279 heavily UNK-401 UNK-362 before 
 answering 
 UNK-0 
 im tired of all them rocks in the sea he said and boats and ships . 
 salt junk all the time . 
 UNK-0 
 tired UNK-98 he UNK-167 . his UNK-10 UNK-491 that he was not 
 likely to get a great deal of change out of such a UNK-221 old customer 
 fell to UNK-200 on the enormous dimensions of the water about the 
 globe UNK-207 it to say that as a casual glance at the map revealed 
 it covered fully three UNK-974 of it and he fully UNK-142 accordingly 
 what it meant to rule the waves . on more than one occasion a dozen 
 at the lowest near the north bull at UNK-675 he had UNK-957 a 
 UNK-772 old salt UNK-307 UNK-881 UNK-154 UNK-227 near the 
 not particularly UNK-275 sea on the wall UNK-151 quite UNK-972 at 
 it and it at him UNK-202 of fresh woods and UNK-264 new as someone 
 somewhere UNK-769 . and it left him wondering why . possibly he had tried to 
 find out the secret for himself UNK-621 up and down the UNK-253 
 and all that sort of thing and over and under well not exactly under 
 UNK-282 the UNK-817 . and the odds were twenty to nil there was really no 
 secret about it at all . nevertheless without going into the UNK-270 
 of the business the UNK-50 fact remained that the sea was there in 
 all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had 
 to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went 
 to show how people usually UNK-769 to load that sort of UNK-300 on to the 
 other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were 
 run on UNK-205 the same lines so that for that very reason if no 
 other UNK-101 sunday was a highly UNK-82 institution to which the 
 public at large no matter where living UNK-57 or UNK-652 as the case 
 might be having it brought home to them like that should extend its 
 UNK-980 also to the UNK-822 and UNK-174 service who had 
 to man the UNK-641 and push off and out UNK-22 the elements whatever the 
 season when duty called ireland expects that every man and so on and 
 sometimes had a terrible time of it in the UNK-844 not UNK-779 the 
 irish lights UNK-889 and others liable to UNK-35 at any moment UNK-42 
 which he once with his daughter had experienced some UNK-56 UNK-517 
 not to say UNK-480 weather . 
 UNK-0 
 there was a fellow UNK-497 with me in the rover the old UNK-100 
 himself a rover UNK-360 went UNK-377 and took up a soft job as 
 UNK-885 UNK-499 at six UNK-260 a month . them are his UNK-48 UNK-201 on 
 me and he gave me an UNK-677 and that UNK-540 . im game for that job 
 UNK-699 and UNK-384 . i hate UNK-765 about . UNK-6 my son now danny 
 run off to sea and his mother got him took in a UNK-238 in cork where 
 he could be drawing easy money . 
 UNK-0 
 what age is he ? UNK-426 one UNK-171 who by the way seen from the 
 side UNK-135 a distant UNK-973 to henry campbell the UNK-176 away 
 from the UNK-545 UNK-89 of office UNK-737 of course and in a UNK-238 
 UNK-749 and a strong UNK-488 of UNK-800 about the UNK-116 UNK-25 . 
 UNK-0 
 why the UNK-99 answered with a slow UNK-555 UNK-652 my son danny ? 
 UNK-25 be about UNK-424 now way i figure it . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-359 father UNK-124 UNK-814 open his grey or UNK-149 UNK-58 
 shirt with his two hands and UNK-274 away at his chest on which was to 
 be seen an image UNK-32 in blue chinese ink intended to represent an 
 anchor . 
 UNK-0 
 there was UNK-454 in that UNK-574 in UNK-539 he UNK-957 sure as nuts . 
 i must get a wash tomorrow or next day . its them black UNK-498 i objects 
 to . i hate those UNK-847 . suck your blood dry they does . 
 UNK-0 
 seeing they were all looking at his chest he UNK-396 UNK-867 
 his shirt more open so that on top of the UNK-132 symbol of the 
 UNK-80 hope and rest they had a full view of the figure UNK-797 and a 
 young UNK-54 UNK-961 looking UNK-355 rather . 
 UNK-0 
 tattoo the UNK-2 explained . that was done when we were UNK-545 
 UNK-106 off UNK-899 in the black sea under captain UNK-489 . fellow the 
 name of antonio done that . there he is himself a greek . 
 UNK-0 
 did it hurt much doing it ? one asked the UNK-99 . 
 UNK-0 
 that worthy however was UNK-796 engaged in collecting round the . 
 UNK-274 in his . UNK-470 or . 
 UNK-0 
 see here he said showing antonio . there he is UNK-683 the mate . and 
 there he is now he added the same fellow pulling the skin with his 
 fingers some special UNK-943 UNK-307 and he laughing at a yarn . 
 UNK-0 
 and in point of fact the young man named UNK-65 UNK-460 face did 
 actually look like forced UNK-21 and the curious effect excited the 
 UNK-842 UNK-870 of everybody including UNK-78 who this 
 time UNK-269 over . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-42 ay UNK-279 the UNK-99 looking down on his UNK-306 chest . UNK-2 gone 
 too . ate by UNK-974 after . UNK-42 ay . 
 UNK-0 
 he let go of the skin so that the profile UNK-604 the normal expression 
 of before . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-522 bit of work one UNK-3 said . 
 UNK-0 
 and whats the number for ? UNK-64 number two UNK-426 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-361 alive ? a third asked the UNK-99 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-42 ay UNK-279 again the latter UNK-726 more UNK-200 this 
 time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the 
 direction of the UNK-10 about the number . ate . a greek he was . 
 UNK-0 
 and then he added with rather UNK-161 UNK-179 considering his alleged 
 end 
 UNK-0 
 as bad as old antonio for he left me on my UNK-402 . 
 UNK-0 
 the face of a UNK-603 UNK-577 and UNK-845 under a black UNK-197 hat 
 UNK-427 UNK-533 round the door of the shelter UNK-840 UNK-56 on 
 her own with the object of bringing more UNK-291 to her mill . mr 
 bloom UNK-253 knowing which way to look turned away on the moment 
 UNK-806 but UNK-635 calm and picking up from the table the pink 
 sheet of the UNK-497 street organ which the UNK-469 if such he was had 
 laid aside he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though 
 why pink . his reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment 
 round the door the same face he had caught a UNK-631 UNK-332 of that 
 afternoon on UNK-421 UNK-118 the partially UNK-8 female namely of the 
 lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you mrs b . 
 and UNK-113 the chance of his washing . also why washing which seemed 
 rather UNK-209 than not your washing . still UNK-171 UNK-611 him to 
 admit he had UNK-466 his UNK-522 UNK-500 when UNK-799 in UNK-305 
 street and women would and did too a UNK-54 similar UNK-829 UNK-819 
 with UNK-5 and UNK-238 marking ink UNK-349 were that is if they really 
 loved him that is to say love me love my dirty shirt . still just 
 then being on UNK-462 he desired the females room more than her 
 company so it came as a genuine relief when the UNK-430 made her a UNK-292 
 sign to take herself off . round the side of the evening UNK-323 he 
 just caught a UNK-631 UNK-332 of her face round the side of the door 
 with a kind of UNK-89 UNK-86 UNK-205 showing that she was not exactly all 
 there viewing with evident UNK-762 the group of UNK-867 round UNK-808 
 UNK-764 UNK-518 chest and then there was no more of her . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-48 the UNK-430 said . 
 UNK-0 
 it beats me mr bloom UNK-837 to stephen UNK-452 i am speaking 
 how a UNK-640 creature like that from the lock hospital UNK-374 with 
 disease can be UNK-389 enough to UNK-537 or how any man in his UNK-357 
 UNK-344 if he values his health in the least . UNK-4 creature ! of 
 course i suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition . 
 still no matter what the cause is from . . . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen had not noticed her and UNK-57 his UNK-61 merely 
 UNK-808 
 UNK-0 
 in this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a 
 UNK-710 trade . fear not them that sell the body but have not power to 
 buy the soul . she is a bad merchant . she buys dear and sells cheap . 
 UNK-0 
 the elder man though not by any manner of means an old UNK-685 or a UNK-903 
 said it was nothing short of a UNK-273 UNK-47 that ought to be put a 
 stop to UNK-351 to say that women of that stamp quite apart from 
 any UNK-208 UNK-757 on the subject a necessary evil w UNK-971 
 not licensed and UNK-452 UNK-247 by the proper authorities a thing 
 he could UNK-460 state he as a UNK-199 was a UNK-744 
 advocate of from the very first start . UNK-862 UNK-397 on a policy of 
 the sort he said and UNK-225 the matter thoroughly would UNK-25 a 
 lasting UNK-263 on everybody concerned . 
 UNK-0 
 you as a good catholic he observed talking of body and soul believe 
 in the soul . or do you mean the intelligence the UNK-414 as such 
 as distinct from any outside object the table let us say that cup . i 
 believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as 
 the UNK-896 of the grey matter . otherwise we would never have such 
 UNK-755 as x rays for instance . do you ? 
 UNK-0 
 thus UNK-158 stephen had to make a UNK-319 effort of memory to try 
 and concentrate and remember before he could say 
 UNK-0 
 they tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and 
 therefore UNK-940 . it would be UNK-605 i understand but for the 
 possibility of its UNK-912 by its first cause who from all i 
 can hear is quite capable of adding that to the number of his other 
 practical jokes UNK-890 per se and UNK-890 per UNK-47 both 
 being excluded by court UNK-168 . 
 UNK-0 
 mr bloom thoroughly UNK-449 in the general UNK-742 of this though the 
 UNK-738 UNK-475 involved was a bit out of his UNK-600 depth still 
 he felt bound to enter a UNK-415 on the head of simple promptly 
 UNK-508 
 UNK-0 
 simple ? i UNK-718 think that is the proper word . of course i grant 
 you to UNK-743 a point you do knock across a simple soul once in a 
 blue moon . but what i am UNK-860 to arrive at is it is one thing for 
 instance to UNK-260 those rays UNK-870 did or the telescope like UNK-526 
 though i believe it was before his time UNK-622 was the man i mean 
 and the same applies to the laws for example of a UNK-384 natural 
 phenomenon such as electricity but its a horse of quite another colour 
 to say you believe in the existence of a UNK-303 god . 
 UNK-0 
 o that stephen UNK-106 has been proved UNK-52 by several 
 of the UNK-726 UNK-409 in holy UNK-799 apart from UNK-51 
 evidence . 
 UNK-0 
 on this UNK-635 point however the views of the pair UNK-445 apart as they 
 were both in UNK-714 and everything else with the marked difference in 
 their respective ages UNK-694 . 
 UNK-0 
 has been ? the more experienced of the two UNK-357 UNK-925 to his 
 original point with a smile of UNK-853 . im not so sure about that . 
 thats a matter for UNK-328 opinion and without UNK-873 in the 
 UNK-302 side of the business i UNK-429 to differ with you in UNK-735 
 there . my belief is to tell you the UNK-98 truth that those bits were 
 genuine UNK-30 all of them put in by UNK-406 most probably or its the 
 big question of our national poet over again who precisely wrote them 
 like UNK-107 and bacon as you who know your shakespeare UNK-145 
 better than i of course i UNK-449 tell you . cant you drink that 
 coffee by the way ? let me UNK-94 it . and take a piece of that UNK-944 . its 
 like one of our UNK-715 UNK-720 UNK-41 . still UNK-159 can give what 
 he UNK-696 got . try a bit . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-18 stephen UNK-769 to get out his mental UNK-328 for the 
 moment UNK-466 to UNK-599 further . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-459 being a UNK-523 bad hat mr bloom thought well to UNK-94 
 or try to the UNK-262 sugar from the bottom and reflected with something 
 UNK-781 UNK-629 on the coffee palace and its UNK-267 and 
 UNK-940 work . to be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or 
 UNK-376 did a world of good UNK-370 such as the present one they were in 
 run on UNK-959 lines for UNK-384 at night concerts dramatic UNK-648 
 and useful lectures UNK-559 free by qualified men for the lower 
 orders . on the other hand he had a distinct and painful UNK-141 
 they paid his wife UNK-280 marion UNK-267 who had been UNK-824 
 associated with it at one time a very UNK-511 UNK-843 indeed for 
 her UNK-774 . the idea he was strongly UNK-444 to believe was 
 to do good and net a profit there being no competition to speak 
 of . UNK-595 of copper poison UNK-46 or something in some dried peas he 
 remembered reading of in a cheap UNK-393 somewhere but he UNK-18 
 remember when it was or where . UNK-58 inspection medical inspection 
 of all UNK-300 seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly 
 UNK-646 for the UNK-300 of dr UNK-219 UNK-892 on account of the 
 medical analysis involved . 
 UNK-0 
 have a shot at it now he UNK-625 to say of the coffee after being 
 UNK-937 . 
 UNK-0 
 thus UNK-778 on to at any rate taste it stephen UNK-64 the heavy mug 
 from the brown UNK-391 it UNK-208 out of when taken up by the handle and 
 took a sip of the UNK-518 beverage . 
 UNK-0 
 still its solid food his good genius UNK-318 im a UNK-710 for solid 
 food his one and only reason being not UNK-983 in the least but 
 regular meals as the UNK-972 UNK-219 non for any kind of proper work mental 
 or manual . you ought to eat more solid food . you would feel a different 
 man . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-82 i can eat stephen said . but o UNK-373 me by taking away that 
 knife . i cant look at the point of it . it UNK-137 me of roman history . 
 UNK-0 
 mr bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the UNK-236 article 
 a UNK-436 UNK-669 ordinary knife with nothing particularly roman or 
 antique about it to the lay eye UNK-532 that the point was the least 
 UNK-793 point about it . 
 UNK-0 
 our mutual friends stories are like himself mr bloom UNK-334 of 
 knives UNK-957 to his UNK-375 UNK-881 UNK-346 . do you think they are 
 genuine ? he could spin those UNK-320 for hours on end all night long and 
 lie like old boots . look at him . 
 UNK-0 
 yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was 
 full of a host of things and UNK-794 of a terrible nature and it 
 was quite within the UNK-784 of possibility that it was not an 
 entire UNK-668 though at first UNK-801 there was not much UNK-594 
 probability in all the UNK-403 he got off his chest being strictly 
 accurate gospel . 
 UNK-0 
 he had been UNK-477 taking stock of the individual in front of him and 
 UNK-830 him up ever since he UNK-27 eyes on him . though a 
 UNK-61 man of no little UNK-684 if a UNK-442 UNK-805 to UNK-582 
 there was something UNK-45 in the cut of his UNK-50 that suggested a jail 
 delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate 
 such a UNK-405 UNK-540 with the UNK-525 and UNK-29 UNK-207 . he 
 might even have done for his man UNK-885 it was his own case he told 
 as people often did about others namely that he killed him himself 
 and had served his four or five UNK-286 years in UNK-13 UNK-200 to say 
 nothing of the antonio UNK-726 no relation to the dramatic UNK-726 
 of identical name who UNK-418 from the pen of our national poet who 
 UNK-740 his crimes in the UNK-836 manner above described . on the 
 other hand he might be only UNK-957 a UNK-203 UNK-688 because 
 meeting UNK-844 UNK-903 dublin residents like those UNK-91 waiting 
 news from abroad would UNK-876 any ancient UNK-542 who UNK-497 the ocean 
 seas to draw the long bow about the UNK-469 UNK-906 and UNK-255 . 
 and when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself 
 UNK-18 probably hold a UNK-701 candle to the wholesale UNK-742 
 other UNK-13 UNK-554 about him . 
 UNK-0 
 mind you im not saying that its all a pure invention he UNK-604 . 
 UNK-38 scenes are occasionally if not often met with . giants 
 though that is rather a far cry you see once in a way UNK-592 the 
 UNK-800 queen . in those UNK-988 in henry street i myself saw some 
 UNK-477 as they are called sitting UNK-893 they UNK-18 UNK-532 
 their legs if you paid them because the muscles here you see he 
 UNK-360 indicating on his companion the brief outline of the UNK-265 
 or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee were UNK-944 
 UNK-262 from sitting that way so long UNK-738 up being UNK-497 as 
 gods . UNK-6 an example again of simple souls . 
 UNK-0 
 however UNK-799 to friend UNK-472 and his UNK-69 adventures who 
 UNK-610 him a bit of UNK-735 alias UNK-683 when he occupied 
 the boards of the UNK-671 when michael UNK-918 was identified with the 
 management in the flying UNK-889 a UNK-94 success and his host 
 of UNK-652 came in large numbers everyone simply UNK-302 to hear him 
 though ships of any sort phantom or the reverse on the stage usually 
 fell a bit flat as also did trains there was nothing UNK-927 
 UNK-197 about it he UNK-111 . on the contrary that UNK-332 in the 
 back touch was quite in keeping with those UNK-930 though UNK-38 he 
 was none the less free to admit those UNK-883 and UNK-672 in the fish 
 way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little 
 italy there near the UNK-583 were UNK-357 UNK-890 UNK-389 UNK-13 
 except perhaps a bit too given to UNK-602 the UNK-713 necessary 
 animal of the UNK-129 UNK-306 of others at night so as to have a good 
 old UNK-553 UNK-758 with garlic de UNK-650 off him or her next day on 
 the quiet and he added on the cheap . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-279 for instance he continued UNK-954 UNK-504 like 
 that UNK-801 as old nick are given to taking the law into their own 
 hands and give you your UNK-269 UNK-453 with those UNK-147 they 
 carry in the UNK-364 . it comes from the great heat climate generally . 
 my wife is so to speak spanish half that is . point of fact she could 
 actually claim spanish UNK-472 if she wanted having been born in 
 UNK-832 spain i UNK-814 . gibraltar . she has the spanish type . quite 
 dark regular brunette black . i for one certainly believe climate 
 accounts for character . thats why i asked you if you wrote your poetry 
 in italian . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-504 at the door stephen UNK-745 with were very 
 UNK-954 about ten UNK-51 . UNK-391 UNK-827 UNK-889 UNK-138 . 
 UNK-0 
 quite so mr bloom UNK-355 . 
 UNK-0 
 then stephen said UNK-151 and UNK-382 on to himself or some unknown 
 UNK-584 somewhere we have the UNK-736 of UNK-68 and the UNK-725 
 triangle miss UNK-223 he fell in love with and UNK-520 and san 
 UNK-938 UNK-656 . 
 UNK-0 
 its in the blood mr bloom UNK-669 at once . all are UNK-466 in the 
 blood of the sun . UNK-780 i just happened to be in the UNK-328 
 street museum UNK-487 today shortly prior to our meeting if i can so call 
 it and i was just looking at those antique UNK-848 there . the UNK-288 
 UNK-709 of UNK-40 UNK-186 . you simply dont knock against those kind of 
 women here . an exception here and there . UNK-218 yes pretty in a way 
 you find but what im talking about is the female form . besides they 
 have so little taste in dress most of them which greatly UNK-291 a 
 UNK-95 natural beauty no matter what you say . UNK-558 stockings it 
 may be possibly is a UNK-577 of mine but still its a thing i simply 
 hate to see . 
 UNK-0 
 interest however was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the 
 others got on to talking about accidents at sea ships lost in a fog 
 UNK-98 UNK-933 with UNK-85 all that sort of thing . UNK-528 of course 
 had his own say to say . he had UNK-307 the cape a few odd times and 
 UNK-970 a UNK-696 a kind of wind in the china seas and through all 
 those UNK-756 of the deep there was one thing he declared stood to him 
 or words to that effect a UNK-290 medal he had that saved him . 
 UNK-0 
 so then after that they UNK-31 on to the UNK-798 off UNK-974 rock UNK-798 
 of that UNK-471 norwegian UNK-95 nobody could think of her name for 
 the moment till the UNK-469 who had really quite a look of henry campbell 
 remembered it UNK-71 on UNK-962 strand . that was the talk of the 
 town that year albert william UNK-184 wrote a fine piece of original 
 verse of UNK-838 UNK-683 merit on the topic for the irish times 
 UNK-743 running over her and UNK-291 and UNK-291 on the shore in 
 UNK-683 UNK-628 with horror . then someone said something about the 
 case of the s . s . lady UNK-557 of UNK-317 run into by the UNK-236 which 
 was on an opposite UNK-158 in rather UNK-40 weather and lost with all 
 hands on deck . no aid was given . her master the UNK-152 said he 
 was afraid his UNK-151 UNK-400 would give way . she had no water it 
 appears in her hold . 
 UNK-0 
 at this stage an incident happened . it having become necessary for him 
 to UNK-268 a reef the UNK-99 UNK-325 his seat . 
 UNK-0 
 let me cross your UNK-131 mate he said to his UNK-379 who was just 
 gently UNK-794 off into a peaceful UNK-183 . 
 UNK-0 
 he made tracks heavily slowly with a UNK-199 sort of a UNK-965 to the door 
 UNK-426 heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and UNK-135 
 due left . while he was in the act of getting his UNK-475 mr bloom who 
 noticed when he stood up that he had two UNK-355 of UNK-460 ships 
 UNK-647 UNK-925 one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his 
 burning interior saw him produce a bottle and UNK-991 it or UNK-74 and 
 applying its UNK-820 to his lips take a good old UNK-826 UNK-144 out of 
 it with a UNK-972 noise . the UNK-460 bloom who also had a 
 UNK-295 UNK-488 that the old UNK-130 went out on a UNK-841 after the 
 UNK-715 in the shape of a female who however had UNK-165 
 to all UNK-409 and purposes could by UNK-50 just UNK-680 him when 
 UNK-816 UNK-406 by his UNK-647 UNK-215 UNK-905 UNK-775 up at the UNK-670 and 
 UNK-216 of the loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all 
 UNK-825 altered since his last visit and greatly improved . some person 
 or persons invisible directed him to the male UNK-107 UNK-671 by the 
 UNK-982 committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief 
 space of time during which silence UNK-137 supreme the UNK-99 UNK-307 
 giving it a wide UNK-608 UNK-458 himself closer at hand the noise of his 
 UNK-682 some little time subsequently UNK-372 on the ground where 
 it apparently UNK-170 a horse of the UNK-663 . a UNK-262 UNK-151 anyway for 
 new UNK-571 after sleep and UNK-310 UNK-39 . slightly disturbed in his 
 UNK-795 by the UNK-59 of live UNK-204 the UNK-398 of the corporation 
 stones who though now broken down and fast breaking up was none other 
 in UNK-977 reality than the UNK-446 UNK-210 now UNK-82 on the 
 parish rates given the temporary job by pat UNK-166 in all human 
 probability from UNK-490 of humanity knowing him before UNK-12 about 
 and UNK-643 in his box before UNK-373 his UNK-477 again in to the arms 
 of UNK-254 a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most UNK-363 
 form on a fellow most UNK-417 connected and UNK-90 with decent 
 home UNK-416 all his life who came in for a cool UNK-703 pounds a year 
 at one time which of course the UNK-508 ass UNK-360 to make 
 general UNK-896 and UNK-987 of . and there he was at the end of his UNK-140 
 after having often painted the town UNK-994 pink without a UNK-874 
 UNK-916 . he UNK-59 UNK-647 to be told and it pointed only once more a 
 moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business UNK-664 
 big if UNK-423 had UNK-769 to cure himself of his particular 
 UNK-320 . 
 UNK-0 
 all UNK-477 were UNK-76 UNK-617 the falling off in irish shipping 
 UNK-374 and foreign as well which was all part and parcel of the same 
 thing . a UNK-691 murphy boat was put off the ways at UNK-936 basin 
 the only launch that year . right enough the UNK-703 were there only no 
 ships ever called . 
 UNK-0 
 there were UNK-322 and UNK-381 the UNK-430 said who was UNK-307 au 
 UNK-143 . 
 UNK-0 
 what he wanted to UNK-9 was why that ship ran bang against the only 
 rock in UNK-553 bay when the UNK-553 harbour scheme was UNK-202 by a mr 
 UNK-377 or some name like that eh ? ask the then captain he advised 
 them how much UNK-383 the british government gave him for that days 
 work captain john UNK-576 of the UNK-576 line . 
 UNK-0 
 am i right UNK-808 ? he UNK-426 of the UNK-99 now returning after his 
 private UNK-467 and the rest of his UNK-530 . 
 UNK-0 
 that worthy picking up the UNK-111 of the UNK-109 of the song or words 
 UNK-102 in UNK-291 music but with great UNK-549 some kind of UNK-113 or other 
 in seconds or UNK-156 . mr UNK-34 sharp ears heard him then UNK-675 
 the plug probably which it was so that he must have UNK-15 it for the 
 time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs 
 and found it a bit UNK-878 after the liquid fire in question . UNK-58 in 
 he rolled after his successful UNK-215 introducing an 
 atmosphere of drink into the UNK-717 UNK-299 UNK-274 like a 
 UNK-200 son of a UNK-417 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 the UNK-140 was as hard as brass 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 and the beef as salt as lots UNK-522 UNK-865 . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 o johnny UNK-576 ! 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 johnny UNK-576 o ! 
 UNK-0 
 after which UNK-84 the UNK-600 UNK-540 UNK-816 arrived on the scene 
 and UNK-30 his seat he UNK-443 rather than sat heavily on the form 
 provided . UNK-78 assuming he was he UNK-307 with an UNK-900 to 
 UNK-487 was UNK-422 his UNK-628 in a UNK-241 UNK-298 UNK-15 
 the natural resources of ireland or something of that sort which he 
 described in his UNK-480 UNK-577 as the UNK-280 country bar none on 
 the face of gods earth far and away superior to england with coal in 
 large quantities six million pounds worth of pork UNK-318 every year 
 ten millions between butter and eggs and all the UNK-281 UNK-962 out of 
 it by england UNK-453 taxes on the poor people that paid through the 
 nose always and UNK-401 up the best meat in the market and a lot more 
 surplus steam in the same UNK-249 . their conversation accordingly became 
 general and all agreed that that was a fact . you could grow any UNK-235 
 thing in irish soil he stated and there was that UNK-655 UNK-389 down 
 there in UNK-731 growing tobacco . where would you find anywhere the like 
 of irish bacon ? but a day of UNK-832 he stated UNK-571 with no 
 UNK-481 voice thoroughly UNK-329 all the conversation was in 
 store for mighty england despite her power of UNK-76 on account of her 
 crimes . there would be a fall and the greatest fall in history . 
 the UNK-438 and the UNK-361 were going to have their little UNK-115 he 
 UNK-559 . the UNK-187 were the beginning of the end . UNK-235 england was 
 UNK-525 already and her UNK-540 would be ireland her UNK-617 heel 
 which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of UNK-617 the 
 greek hero a point his UNK-852 at once UNK-457 as he completely UNK-61 
 their attention by showing the UNK-819 referred to on his boot . his 
 advice to every UNK-843 was stay in the land of your birth and work 
 for ireland and live for ireland . ireland UNK-121 said could not spare 
 a single one of her sons . 
 UNK-0 
 silence all round marked the termination of his UNK-317 . the UNK-45 
 navigator heard these UNK-323 UNK-500 UNK-62 . 
 UNK-0 
 take a bit of doing boss UNK-442 that rough diamond UNK-840 a 
 bit UNK-67 in response to the UNK-634 UNK-416 . 
 UNK-0 
 to which cold UNK-994 referring to UNK-540 and so on the UNK-430 
 UNK-939 but nevertheless held to his main view . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-169 the best troops in the army ? the UNK-635 old veteran UNK-680 
 UNK-913 . and the best UNK-909 and UNK-585 ? and the best UNK-84 and 
 UNK-925 UNK-623 got ? tell me that . 
 UNK-0 
 the irish for choice UNK-210 the UNK-821 like campbell facial 
 UNK-639 apart . 
 UNK-0 
 thats right the old UNK-985 UNK-672 . the irish catholic 
 UNK-720 . UNK-2 the UNK-24 of our empire . you know UNK-686 UNK-43 ? 
 UNK-0 
 while allowing him his individual opinions as UNK-605 the UNK-430 added 
 he UNK-394 nothing for any empire ours or his and considered no UNK-843 
 worthy of his salt that served it . then they began to have a few 
 UNK-880 words when it UNK-22 UNK-612 both UNK-647 to say UNK-662 
 to the UNK-797 who followed the passage of arms with interest so long 
 as they UNK-3 UNK-818 in UNK-340 and come to UNK-277 . 
 UNK-0 
 from inside information extending over a series of years mr bloom was 
 rather UNK-444 to UNK-612 the suggestion as UNK-436 UNK-908 for 
 pending that UNK-82 UNK-891 to be or not to be UNK-136 for he was 
 fully UNK-737 of the fact that their UNK-611 across the channel 
 unless they were much bigger UNK-972 than he took them for rather 
 UNK-494 their strength than the opposite . it was quite on a par with 
 the UNK-695 idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years 
 the coal UNK-473 of the sister island would be played out and if as 
 time went on that turned out to be how the cat UNK-615 all he could 
 personally say on the matter was that as a host of UNK-94 
 equally relevant to the issue might occur UNK-971 then it was highly 
 UNK-920 in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even 
 though UNK-445 apart . another little interesting point the UNK-0 of 
 UNK-264 and UNK-547 to put it in common UNK-315 UNK-610 him irish 
 soldiers had as often fought for england as against her more so in 
 fact . and now why ? so the scene between the pair of them the UNK-479 
 of the place UNK-962 to be or have been UNK-421 the famous 
 UNK-838 and the other obviously UNK-723 UNK-610 him UNK-441 as 
 being on all UNK-411 with the confidence trick UNK-885 that is it was 
 UNK-980 as the UNK-650 a student of the human soul if anything 
 the others seeing least of the game . and as for the UNK-991 or UNK-430 
 who probably UNK-69 the other person at all he b . UNK-18 help 
 feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the 
 UNK-894 unless you were a UNK-374 UNK-818 UNK-537 and refuse to have 
 anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their 
 UNK-972 there always being the UNK-960 of a UNK-862 coming 
 forward and turning queens evidence or kings now like UNK-531 or peter 
 carey an idea he UNK-944 UNK-370 . quite apart from that he UNK-376 
 those careers of UNK-55 and crime on principle . yet though such 
 criminal UNK-307 had never been an UNK-857 of his UNK-186 in any 
 shape or form he certainly did feel and no UNK-209 it while UNK-547 
 remaining what he was a certain kind of UNK-870 for a man who 
 had actually UNK-341 a knife cold steel with the courage of his 
 political UNK-383 though personally he would never be a party to 
 any such thing off the same bat as those love UNK-860 of the south 
 have her or swing for her when the husband frequently after some words 
 passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky 
 UNK-235 he having had the pair watched UNK-45 fatal injuries on 
 his UNK-497 one as a result of an alternative UNK-42 UNK-645 
 by UNK-655 his knife into her until it just struck him that 
 UNK-440 UNK-308 UNK-78 merely drove the car for the actual 
 UNK-904 of the UNK-878 and so was not if he was UNK-577 informed 
 actually party to the UNK-764 which in point of fact was the UNK-519 some 
 legal UNK-138 saved his skin on . in any case that was very ancient 
 history by now and as for our friend the UNK-51 UNK-543 he 
 had UNK-985 UNK-86 his welcome . he ought to have either died 
 naturally or on the UNK-50 high . like UNK-77 always UNK-399 
 UNK-255 last performance then come up UNK-21 again . generous to a 
 fault of course UNK-588 no UNK-354 or any idea of the sort 
 always UNK-602 at the bone for the shadow . so similarly he had a very 
 UNK-295 UNK-488 that mr johnny UNK-576 got rid of some l s d . in the 
 course of his UNK-635 round the UNK-964 in the UNK-708 atmosphere 
 of the old ireland UNK-54 come back to UNK-385 and so on . then as for 
 the other he had heard not so long before the same identical UNK-187 as he 
 told stephen how he simply but UNK-439 UNK-516 the UNK-698 . 
 UNK-0 
 he took UNK-15 at something or other that UNK-858 but on the 
 whole UNK-917 person declared i let slip . he called me a UNK-181 and 
 in a heated fashion UNK-17 . so i without UNK-836 from plain facts 
 in the least told him his god i mean christ was a UNK-181 too and all his 
 family like me though in reality im not . that was one for him . a soft 
 answer turns away UNK-880 . he UNK-180 a word to say for himself as everyone 
 saw . am i not right ? 
 UNK-0 
 he turned a long you are wrong UNK-49 on stephen of UNK-901 dark pride 
 at the soft UNK-356 with a glance also of UNK-282 for he seemed to 
 UNK-821 in a kind of a way that it UNK-69 all exactly . 
 UNK-0 
 ex UNK-125 stephen UNK-799 in a UNK-331 accent their two or 
 four eyes UNK-371 UNK-126 or bloom his name is or after all any 
 other UNK-997 UNK-934 . 
 UNK-0 
 of course mr b . UNK-360 to UNK-268 you must look at both sides 
 of the question . it is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to 
 right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is 
 though every country they say our own UNK-358 included has the 
 government it UNK-988 . but with a little UNK-595 all round . its all 
 very fine to UNK-118 of mutual UNK-845 but what about mutual equality . 
 i UNK-560 violence and UNK-959 in any shape or form . it never 
 reaches anything or stops anything . a revolution must come on the due 
 UNK-489 plan . its a patent UNK-706 on the face of it to hate 
 people because they live round the corner and speak another UNK-728 
 in the next house so to speak . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-841 bloody bridge battle and seven minutes war stephen 
 UNK-522 between UNK-734 UNK-270 and UNK-421 market . 
 UNK-0 
 yes mr bloom thoroughly agreed entirely UNK-945 the remark that 
 was UNK-258 right . and the whole world was full of that sort of 
 thing . 
 UNK-0 
 you just took the words out of my mouth he said . a UNK-940 of 
 UNK-453 evidence that UNK-38 you UNK-18 UNK-956 . . . 
 UNK-0 
 all those UNK-640 UNK-714 in his UNK-369 opinion UNK-716 up 
 bad blood from some UNK-366 of UNK-730 or UNK-691 of some kind 
 UNK-718 supposed to be about a UNK-964 of UNK-88 and a flag were 
 very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of 
 everything UNK-33 and UNK-315 people never knowing when to stop . 
 UNK-0 
 they UNK-63 UNK-957 he UNK-208 . 
 UNK-0 
 he turned away from the others who probably and spoke UNK-221 to so as 
 the others in case they . 
 UNK-0 
 jews he UNK-41 UNK-347 in an aside in UNK-8 ear are accused of 
 UNK-507 . not a UNK-463 of truth in it i can safely say . history would 
 you be surprised to learn UNK-120 up to the UNK-172 spain UNK-551 when the 
 UNK-129 UNK-573 the jews out and england UNK-839 when UNK-979 
 an UNK-810 able UNK-17 who in other UNK-640 has much to answer for 
 imported them . why ? because they are UNK-212 with the proper spirit . they 
 are practical and are proved to be so . i dont want to UNK-818 in any 
 because you know the standard works on the subject and then UNK-40 as 
 you are . but in the economic not UNK-358 religion domain the priest 
 UNK-400 poverty . spain again you saw in the war compared with UNK-574 
 america . UNK-597 . its in the UNK-351 . because if they UNK-3 believe UNK-492 
 go straight to heaven when they die UNK-492 try to live better at least 
 so i think . thats the UNK-214 on which the p UNK-543 raise the wind on false 
 UNK-194 . im he UNK-604 with dramatic force as good an UNK-843 
 as that UNK-292 person i told you about at the UNK-90 and i want to see 
 everyone concluded he all UNK-619 and classes pro UNK-754 having a 
 comfortable UNK-567 income in no UNK-371 fashion either something 
 in the UNK-501 of UNK-999 pounds per UNK-172 . thats the vital issue 
 at stake and its UNK-317 and would be UNK-942 of UNK-477 
 UNK-299 between man and man . at least thats my idea for what its 
 worth . i call that UNK-390 . UNK-294 UNK-204 as we learned a UNK-826 
 of in our classical days in UNK-794 UNK-56 UNK-123 UNK-482 . where you can live 
 well the sense is if you work . 
 UNK-0 
 over his UNK-473 UNK-679 for a cup of coffee listening to this 
 synopsis of things in general stephen UNK-156 at nothing in particular . 
 he could hear of course all kinds of words changing colour like those 
 UNK-396 about UNK-220 in the morning UNK-976 quickly into all colours 
 of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere 
 beneath or seemed to . then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or 
 UNK-3 say the words the voice he heard said if you work . 
 UNK-0 
 count me out he managed to remark meaning work . 
 UNK-0 
 the eyes were surprised at this observation because as he the person 
 who owned them pro UNK-135 . observed or rather his voice speaking did all 
 must work have to together . 
 UNK-0 
 i mean of course the other UNK-407 to UNK-467 work in the UNK-858 
 possible sense . also literary labour not merely for the UNK-433 of 
 the thing . writing for the newspapers which is the UNK-973 channel 
 UNK-475 . thats work too . important work . after all from the little 
 i know of you after all the money UNK-869 on your education you are 
 entitled to UNK-897 yourself and command your price . you have every bit 
 as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the 
 UNK-720 has . what ? you both belong to ireland the brain and the UNK-431 . 
 each is equally important . 
 UNK-0 
 you suspect stephen UNK-210 with a sort of a half laugh that i may 
 be important because i belong to the UNK-603 saint UNK-424 called 
 ireland for short . 
 UNK-0 
 i would go a step UNK-199 mr bloom UNK-163 . 
 UNK-0 
 but i suspect stephen UNK-9 that ireland must be important 
 because it belongs to me . 
 UNK-0 
 what belongs UNK-426 mr bloom UNK-277 UNK-238 he was perhaps under 
 some UNK-634 . excuse me . unfortunately i UNK-3 catch the 
 latter portion . what was it you . . . ? 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-723 UNK-220 repeated and UNK-753 aside his mug of 
 coffee or whatever you like to call it none too UNK-269 adding UNK-218 
 UNK-0 
 we cant change the country . let us change the subject . 
 UNK-0 
 at this UNK-770 suggestion mr bloom to change the subject looked 
 down but in a UNK-957 as he UNK-18 tell exactly what construction 
 to put on belongs to which UNK-224 rather a far cry . the UNK-598 of some 
 kind was UNK-598 than the other part . UNK-647 to say the UNK-96 of 
 his recent orgy spoke then with some UNK-26 in a curious UNK-412 way 
 foreign to his UNK-357 state . probably the UNK-148 to which mr b attached 
 the UNK-881 importance had not been all that was UNK-956 or he UNK-180 
 been UNK-90 with the right sort of people . with a touch of fear 
 for the young man beside him whom he UNK-750 UNK-34 with an air 
 of some UNK-665 UNK-617 he had just come back from paris 
 the eyes more especially UNK-757 him UNK-441 of father and sister 
 failing to throw much light on the subject however he brought to mind 
 instances of UNK-977 UNK-13 that promised so UNK-170 UNK-850 in the 
 UNK-685 of UNK-593 UNK-857 and nobody to blame but themselves . for instance 
 there was the case of UNK-600 for one the UNK-481 UNK-41 
 UNK-417 connected though of UNK-939 means with his mad UNK-858 
 among whose other gay UNK-906 when UNK-177 and making himself a UNK-0 
 to everybody all round he was in the UNK-158 of UNK-917 sporting in 
 public a suit of brown paper a fact . and then the usual UNK-779 
 after the fun had gone on fast and UNK-942 he got UNK-104 UNK-961 into hot 
 water and had to be UNK-226 away by a few friends after a strong hint 
 to a blind horse from john UNK-567 of lower castle yard so as not to 
 be made UNK-754 under section two of the criminal law amendment act 
 certain names of those UNK-336 being handed in but not UNK-116 
 for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of UNK-439 . briefly 
 putting two and two together six UNK-752 which he UNK-4 turned a 
 deaf ear to antonio and so forth UNK-196 and UNK-295 and the tattoo 
 which was all the go in the UNK-481 or UNK-770 even in the house 
 of UNK-153 because early in life the UNK-936 of the UNK-980 then UNK-759 
 apparent the other members of the upper ten and other high UNK-222 
 simply following in the UNK-981 of the head of the state he reflected 
 about the errors of UNK-580 and UNK-818 heads running counter to 
 UNK-83 such as the cornwall case a number of years before under their 
 UNK-583 in a way UNK-253 intended by nature a thing good mrs UNK-770 
 as the law stands was UNK-313 down on though not for the reason they 
 thought they were probably whatever it was except women UNK-430 who were 
 always UNK-755 more or less at one another it being largely a matter of 
 dress and all the rest of it . ladies who like UNK-683 UNK-806 
 should and every UNK-626 man must trying to make the gap wider 
 between them by UNK-683 and give more of a genuine UNK-712 to acts of 
 UNK-924 between the two she UNK-132 his and then he UNK-122 her 
 mind the pin whereas UNK-32 in the UNK-239 islands say at UNK-281 
 degrees in the shade not caring a continental . however UNK-799 to the 
 original there were on the other hand others who had forced their way 
 to the top from the lowest UNK-817 by the aid of their UNK-108 . sheer 
 force of natural genius that . with UNK-439 sir . 
 UNK-0 
 for which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even 
 to wait on and profit by the UNK-440 occasion though why he could 
 not exactly tell being as it was already several UNK-51 to the 
 bad having in fact let himself in for it . still to UNK-720 the 
 UNK-930 of someone of no UNK-119 UNK-2 who could provide food 
 for reflection would UNK-401 UNK-749 any small . intellectual UNK-899 
 as such was he felt from time to time a UNK-431 UNK-781 for the mind . 
 added to which was the UNK-780 of meeting discussion dance row 
 old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type night UNK-949 the 
 whole galaxy of events all went to make up a miniature UNK-147 of the 
 world we live in especially as the lives of the UNK-52 UNK-205 UNK-120 . 
 UNK-31 UNK-8 UNK-791 etc . were very much under the UNK-57 
 lately . to improve the UNK-160 hour he UNK-105 whether he might meet 
 with anything UNK-781 the same luck as mr philip UNK-645 if taken 
 down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the common 
 groove as he fully intended doing at the rate of one guinea per 
 column . my experiences let us say in a UNK-791 shelter . 
 UNK-0 
 the pink edition extra sporting of the UNK-323 tell a graphic lie 
 lay as luck would have it beside his UNK-213 and as he was just UNK-925 
 again far from satisfied over a country UNK-995 to him and the 
 preceding UNK-60 the vessel came from UNK-539 and the postcard was 
 addressed a . UNK-52 find the UNK-978 age his eyes went UNK-33 
 over the respective UNK-579 which came under his special province the 
 UNK-544 give us this day our daily press . first he got a bit of a 
 start but it turned out to be only something about somebody named h . 
 du UNK-383 agent for UNK-471 or something like that . great battle 
 UNK-740 . UNK-63 in irish UNK-997 pounds damages . gordon bennett . 
 UNK-969 UNK-970 . letter from his grace . william . UNK-478 meeting 
 the gold cup . victory of UNK-478 UNK-458 UNK-608 derby of UNK-146 when 
 UNK-92 . UNK-485 dark horse sir hugo captured the blue UNK-940 at long 
 odds . new york disaster . thousand lives lost . foot and mouth . funeral of 
 the late mr patrick UNK-28 . 
 UNK-0 
 so to change the subject he read about UNK-28 r . i . p . which he 
 reflected was anything but a gay UNK-347 . or a change of address 
 anyway . 
 UNK-0 
 this morning UNK-45 put it in of course the remains of the late mr 
 patrick UNK-28 were removed from his residence no UNK-434 UNK-968 avenue 
 UNK-476 for UNK-932 in UNK-503 . the UNK-396 gentleman was a 
 most popular and UNK-449 personality in city life and his UNK-430 after a 
 brief illness came as a great shock to citizens of all classes by whom 
 he is deeply UNK-255 . the UNK-69 at which many friends of the 
 UNK-396 were present were carried out certainly UNK-45 wrote it with 
 a UNK-117 from UNK-82 by UNK-428 h . j . UNK-99 and son UNK-28 north strand

 line of UNK-267 type but UNK-448 to death simultaneously by c . p . UNK-37

 UNK-368 not UNK-779 the usual crop of UNK-132 UNK-492 of

 UNK-0 
 is that first UNK-919 to the UNK-512 he asked as soon as his bottom 
 UNK-110 would let him in ? text open thy mouth and put thy foot in it . 
 UNK-0 
 it is . really mr bloom said though first he UNK-87 he UNK-597 to 
 the UNK-115 till he added about foot and mouth with which there could 
 be no possible connection UNK-794 to set his mind at rest and a bit 
 UNK-939 at UNK-128 UNK-321 after all managing to . there . 
 UNK-0 
 while the other was reading it on page two boom to give him for the

 ii . different ways of bringing off a UNK-561 . UNK-63 damages . though 
 that UNK-849 UNK-152 ran off at a UNK-199 in his UNK-736 to get 
 left . of course gambling UNK-499 UNK-256 itself to that sort of thing 
 though as the event turned out the poor fool UNK-180 much reason to 
 UNK-797 himself on his pick the UNK-875 hope . UNK-596 it reduced 
 itself to eventually . 
 UNK-0 
 there was every indication they would arrive at that he bloom said . 
 UNK-0 
 who ? the other whose hand by the way was hurt said . 
 UNK-0 
 one morning you would open the paper the UNK-380 UNK-559 and read 
 return of UNK-121 . he bet them what they liked . a dublin UNK-488 was 
 in that shelter one night and said he saw him in south africa . pride it 
 was killed him . he ought to have done away with himself or UNK-89 low for 
 a time after committee room no UNK-704 until he was his old self again with 
 UNK-159 to point a finger at him . then they would all to a man have gone 
 down on their UNK-828 to him to come back when he had recovered 
 his UNK-344 . dead he UNK-69 . simply UNK-715 somewhere . the UNK-142 they 
 brought over was full of stones . he changed his name to de wet the UNK-591 
 general . he made a mistake to fight the UNK-73 . and so forth and so on . 
 UNK-0 
 all the same bloom properly so UNK-407 was rather surprised at their 
 memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of UNK-993 and 
 not UNK-166 but in their thousands and then complete UNK-422 because it 
 was twenty odd years . highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow 
 of truth in the stones and even UNK-885 he thought a return highly 
 UNK-595 all things considered . something UNK-307 UNK-236 them in 
 his death . either he UNK-850 out too UNK-73 of acute UNK-86 just when 
 his various different political arrangements were UNK-356 completion 
 or whether it UNK-744 he UNK-998 his death to his having UNK-377 to 
 change his boots and UNK-27 a UNK-93 when a cold resulted and 
 failing to consult a specialist he being UNK-62 to his room till he 
 eventually died of it UNK-22 widespread UNK-675 before a UNK-568 was at 
 an end or quite possibly they were UNK-486 to find the job was taken 
 out of their hands . of course nobody being UNK-265 with his movements 
 even before there was absolutely no UNK-348 as to his UNK-967 which 
 were UNK-837 of the alice where art thou order even prior to his 
 starting to go under several UNK-229 such as fox and stewart so the 
 remark which UNK-566 from friend UNK-821 might be within the UNK-784 of 
 possibility . naturally then it would UNK-659 on his mind as a born leader 
 of men which UNK-590 he was and a UNK-567 figure a UNK-698 
 or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his UNK-943 feet whereas 
 UNK-428 so and so who though they UNK-265 even a patch on the former 
 man ruled the UNK-101 after their UNK-151 features were very few and 
 far between . it certainly pointed a moral the idol with feet of clay 
 and then UNK-75 of his UNK-353 UNK-895 UNK-42 on him with mutual 
 UNK-822 . and the identical same with UNK-316 . you had to come 
 back . that UNK-25 sense kind of drew you . to show the UNK-356 in 
 the title UNK-916 how to . he saw him once on the UNK-25 occasion 
 when they broke up the type in the UNK-234 or was it united 
 ireland a privilege he UNK-345 appreciated and in point of fact 
 handed him his silk hat when it was UNK-442 off and he said thank you 
 excited as he UNK-590 was under his UNK-260 exterior UNK-655 
 the little UNK-289 mentioned between the cup and the lip whats 
 UNK-338 in the bone . still as regards return . you were a lucky dog if 
 they UNK-3 set the UNK-617 at you directly you got back . then a lot of 
 UNK-640 usually followed tom for and dick and harry against . and 
 then number one you came up against the man in possession and had to 
 produce your UNK-852 like the UNK-803 in the UNK-993 case 
 roger charles UNK-993 UNK-131 was the boats name to the best of his 
 UNK-141 he the UNK-759 went down in as the evidence went to show 
 and there was a tattoo mark too in indian ink lord UNK-521 was it as he 
 might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship 
 and then when got up to UNK-990 with the description given introduce 
 himself with excuse me my name is so and so or some such UNK-164 
 remark . a more UNK-381 course as bloom said to the not over UNK-213 
 in fact like the distinguished UNK-726 under discussion beside him 
 would have been to sound the lie of the land first . 
 UNK-0 
 that bitch that english whore did for him the UNK-892 UNK-382 
 commented . she put the first nail in his UNK-142 . 
 UNK-0 
 fine UNK-594 of a woman all the same the UNK-962 UNK-176 henry 
 campbell UNK-957 and plenty of her . she UNK-420 many a UNK-54 UNK-932 . 
 i seen her picture in a UNK-822 . the husband was a captain or an 
 officer . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-42 UNK-78 UNK-148 added he was and a UNK-386 one . 
 UNK-0 
 this UNK-996 contribution of a UNK-174 character UNK-264 a fair 
 amount of UNK-31 among his UNK-737 . as regards bloom he without 
 the UNK-990 UNK-488 of a smile merely UNK-84 in the direction of 
 the door and reflected upon the historic story which had UNK-754 
 extraordinary interest at the time when the facts to make matters 
 worse were made public with the usual UNK-167 letters that passed 
 between them full of sweet UNK-618 . first it was strictly UNK-476 till 
 nature UNK-575 and an attachment UNK-418 up between them till bit by 
 bit matters came to a UNK-349 and the matter became the talk of the town 
 till the UNK-141 blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few 
 UNK-283 however who were resolved upon UNK-173 his UNK-540 
 though the thing was public property all along though not to anything 
 like the UNK-847 extent that it subsequently UNK-190 into . since 
 their names were coupled though since he was her declared favourite 
 where was the particular necessity to UNK-340 it to the rank and file 
 from the UNK-502 the fact namely that he had shared her bedroom 
 which came out in the UNK-477 on UNK-19 when a UNK-447 went through the 
 packed court literally UNK-733 everybody in the shape of witnesses 
 UNK-128 to having UNK-897 him on such and such a particular date in 
 the act of UNK-906 out of an UNK-316 apartment with the assistance 
 of a ladder in night apparel having gained UNK-559 in the same 
 fashion a fact the UNK-643 UNK-672 to the UNK-863 a little simply 
 UNK-554 UNK-951 of money out of . whereas the simple fact of the case was 
 it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch with 
 nothing in common between them beyond the name and then a real man 
 UNK-44 on the scene strong to the UNK-762 of UNK-688 falling a victim 
 to her UNK-602 charms and UNK-779 home ties the usual UNK-299 to UNK-677 
 in the loved ones UNK-479 . the eternal question of the life UNK-113 
 UNK-647 to say UNK-295 up . can real love UNK-885 there happens to 
 be another UNK-26 in the case exist between married folk ? UNK-9 . 
 though it was no concern of UNK-75 absolutely if he regarded her with 
 UNK-874 carried away by a wave of UNK-813 . a magnificent UNK-540 of 
 UNK-135 he was truly UNK-928 obviously by gifts of a high order as 
 compared with the other military UNK-780 that is who was just the 
 usual everyday UNK-399 my UNK-995 captain kind of an individual in 
 the light UNK-231 the UNK-38 UNK-911 to be accurate and UNK-980 
 UNK-398 the fallen leader that is not the other in his own 
 UNK-702 way which she of course woman quickly perceived as highly 
 likely to UNK-72 his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the 
 UNK-73 and ministers of the gospel as a whole his UNK-894 UNK-497 
 UNK-282 and his UNK-506 UNK-872 UNK-572 for whom he had done UNK-941 
 service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the UNK-592 on 
 their behalf in a way that UNK-378 their most UNK-479 expectations 
 very UNK-439 cooked his UNK-272 UNK-583 thereby UNK-526 UNK-918 of 
 fire on his head much in the same way as the UNK-536 UNK-384 kick . looking 
 back now in a UNK-967 kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of 
 dream . and then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it 
 went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved 
 with the times . why as he reflected UNK-736 strand a UNK-681 he 
 had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow 
 since as it happened he went to UNK-608 on the north side . north or 
 south however it was just the UNK-798 case of hot passion pure and 
 simple UNK-654 the UNK-348 with a UNK-183 and just UNK-135 out the 
 very thing he was saying as she also was spanish or half so types that 
 UNK-9 do things by UNK-945 UNK-954 UNK-665 of the south casting 
 every UNK-412 of UNK-224 to the winds . 
 UNK-0 
 just bears out what i was saying he with UNK-808 UNK-186 said to 
 stephen about blood and the sun . and if i dont greatly mistake she 
 was spanish too . 
 UNK-0 
 the king of UNK-527 daughter stephen answered adding something or 
 other rather UNK-838 about UNK-399 and UNK-845 to you spanish UNK-538 and 
 the first land called the UNK-568 and from UNK-503 to UNK-899 was so and 
 so many . 
 UNK-0 
 was she ? bloom UNK-334 surprised though not UNK-647 by any 
 means i never heard that UNK-390 before . possible especially there it 
 was as she lived there . so spain . 
 UNK-0 
 carefully avoiding a book in his pocket UNK-240 of which UNK-610 him 
 by the by of that cap l street library book out of date he took out his 
 UNK-754 and turning over the various contents it contained rapidly 
 finally he . 
 UNK-0 
 do you consider by the by he said UNK-711 selecting a UNK-238 
 photo which he laid on the table that a spanish type ?

 stephen obviously addressed looked down on the photo showing a large 
 sized lady with her UNK-375 charms on evidence in an open fashion as she 
 was in the full bloom of UNK-122 in evening dress cut UNK-917 
 low for the occasion to give a liberal display of UNK-186 with more than 
 vision of breasts her full lips UNK-621 and some perfect teeth standing 
 near UNK-752 with gravity a piano on the rest of which was in old 
 madrid a UNK-45 pretty in its way which was then all the UNK-300 . her 
 the UNK-532 eyes dark large looked at stephen about to smile about 
 something to be UNK-336 lafayette of UNK-900 street UNK-630 
 premier photographic artist being responsible for the UNK-175 
 execution . 
 UNK-0 
 mrs bloom my wife the UNK-681 donna UNK-280 marion UNK-267 bloom 
 indicated . taken a few years since . in or about UNK-281 six . very like 
 her then . 
 UNK-0 
 beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his 
 UNK-802 legal wife who he UNK-832 was the accomplished daughter of 
 major brian UNK-267 and displayed at an early age remarkable UNK-452 
 as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years 
 UNK-143 barely sweet UNK-752 . as for the face it was a speaking 
 UNK-282 in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which 
 came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the 
 best advantage in that UNK-749 . she could without difficulty he said 
 have UNK-10 for the ensemble not to UNK-790 on certain UNK-593 curves of 
 the . he UNK-210 being a bit of an artist in his spare time on the female 
 form in general UNK-512 because as it so happened no later 
 than that afternoon he had seen those UNK-194 UNK-848 UNK-868 perfectly 
 developed as works of art in the national museum . marble could give 
 the original UNK-61 back all the UNK-465 all the rest . yes 
 UNK-765 it does though saint UNK-490 UNK-480 UNK-169 UNK-649 
 UNK-246 ! UNK-879 UNK-81 UNK-1 . whereas no photo could because it simply 
 UNK-69 art in a word . 
 UNK-0 
 the spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow jack UNK-507 good 
 example and leave the UNK-282 there for a very few minutes to speak for 
 itself on the UNK-519 he so that the other could drink in the beauty for 
 himself her stage presence being UNK-846 a treat in itself which the 
 camera could not at all do justice to . but it was UNK-253 professional 
 UNK-168 so . though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet 
 UNK-328 cool for the season considering for sunshine after storm . 
 and he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a 
 kind of UNK-362 voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion . 
 nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly UNK-799 photo UNK-756 
 by UNK-593 curves none the worse for wear however and looked away 
 UNK-711 with the intention of not further increasing the 
 others possible UNK-878 while UNK-358 her UNK-465 of UNK-11 
 UNK-396 . in fact the slight UNK-970 was only an added charm like 
 the case of UNK-683 slightly UNK-799 good as new much better in fact 
 with the UNK-227 out . suppose she was gone when he ? i looked for the lamp 
 which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of 
 his because he then UNK-738 the morning UNK-641 bed UNK-255 and 
 the book about ruby with met him pike UNK-167 sic in it which must 
 have fell down sufficiently UNK-245 beside the domestic UNK-453 
 with UNK-876 to UNK-369 murray . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-781 of the young man he certainly UNK-67 educated 
 UNK-44 and UNK-363 into the bargain far and away the pick of the 
 bunch though you UNK-9 think he had it in him yet you would . besides 
 he said the picture was UNK-218 which say what you like it was though 
 at the moment she was UNK-589 UNK-854 . and why not ? an awful lot of 
 UNK-552 went on about that sort of thing involving a UNK-834 UNK-177 
 with the usual UNK-128 page of UNK-147 about the same old UNK-272 
 UNK-845 UNK-567 UNK-464 with professional UNK-530 or the newest 
 stage favourite instead of being honest and UNK-478 about the whole 
 business . how they were UNK-819 to meet and an attachment UNK-418 up 
 between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye 
 was told in court with letters containing the UNK-999 UNK-249 and 
 UNK-274 expressions leaving no UNK-186 to show that they UNK-182 
 UNK-660 two or three times a week at some UNK-798 UNK-652 hotel and 
 relations when the thing ran its normal course became in due course 
 intimate . then the UNK-816 UNK-44 and the kings UNK-540 tries to show 
 cause why and he failing to UNK-935 it UNK-44 was made absolute . but as 
 for that the two UNK-890 wrapped up as they largely were in one 
 another could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till 
 the matter was put in the hands of a UNK-698 who filed a petition for 
 the party UNK-258 in due course . he b enjoyed the distinction of being 
 close to UNK-383 UNK-251 king in the flesh when the thing occurred on 
 the historic UNK-257 when the fallen leaders who UNK-617 stuck to 
 his guns to the last drop even when UNK-389 in the UNK-939 of UNK-251 
 leaders UNK-353 UNK-895 to the number of ten or a dozen or 
 possibly even more than that UNK-810 into the printing works of the 
 UNK-234 or no it was united ireland a by no means by the 
 by appropriate UNK-309 and broke up the UNK-801 with UNK-932 or 
 something like that all on account of some UNK-361 UNK-75 from 
 the UNK-980 pens of the UNK-839 UNK-683 at the usual UNK-822 
 occupation UNK-143 on the UNK-894 UNK-129 private UNK-905 . though 
 UNK-840 a UNK-825 altered man he was still a UNK-567 figure though 
 UNK-493 UNK-775 as usual with that look of settled purpose which went 
 a long way with the UNK-570 till they discovered to their vast 
 UNK-746 that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a 
 UNK-367 which she however was the first to UNK-680 . as those were 
 particularly hot times in the general UNK-327 bloom sustained a 
 minor injury from a nasty UNK-663 of some UNK-644 UNK-213 in the crowd that 
 of course UNK-483 lodging some place about the pit of the stomach 
 UNK-347 not of a grave character . his hat UNK-855 a silk one was 
 UNK-445 UNK-442 off and as a matter of strict history bloom was 
 the man who picked it up in the UNK-432 after UNK-704 the occurrence 
 meaning to return it to him and return it to him he did with the UNK-881 
 UNK-581 who UNK-572 and UNK-54 and whose thoughts were miles away 
 from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a 
 stake in the country he as a matter of fact having gone into it more 
 for the UNK-433 of the thing than anything else whats UNK-338 in the bone 
 UNK-579 into him in UNK-340 at his mothers knee in the shape of 
 knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to 
 the donor and UNK-433 him with perfect UNK-7 saying thank you 
 sir though in a very different tone of voice from the UNK-677 of the 
 legal profession whose UNK-898 bloom also set to rights earlier in the 
 course of the day history UNK-598 itself with a difference after 
 the UNK-998 of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory 
 after the UNK-771 task of having committed his remains to the grave . 
 UNK-0 
 on the other hand what UNK-457 him more UNK-547 was the UNK-234 jokes 
 of the UNK-380 and so on who passed it all off as a UNK-545 laughing UNK-457 
 UNK-308 UNK-438 to understand everything the why and the 
 UNK-977 and in reality not knowing their own minds it being a case 
 for the two parties themselves unless it UNK-397 that the legitimate 
 husband happened to be a party to it UNK-812 to some anonymous letter from 
 the usual boy jones who happened to come across them at the crucial 
 moment in a loving position locked in one UNK-69 arms drawing 
 attention to their UNK-565 proceedings and leading up to a domestic 
 UNK-6 and the UNK-470 fair one UNK-301 UNK-258 of her lord and 
 master upon her UNK-111 and promising to UNK-426 the connection and not 
 receive his visits any more if only the UNK-675 husband would UNK-195 
 the matter and let UNK-680 be UNK-680 with tears in her eyes though 
 possibly with her tongue in her fair UNK-139 at the same time as quite 
 possibly there were several others . he personally being of a UNK-8 
 bias believed and UNK-3 make the smallest bones about saying so either 
 that man or men in the UNK-559 were always hanging around on the waiting 
 list about a lady even UNK-885 she was the best wife in the world 
 and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument when 
 UNK-182 her duties she chose to be tired of UNK-682 life and was on 
 for a little UNK-782 in UNK-727 UNK-666 to press their UNK-11 on 
 her with UNK-16 intent the UNK-128 being that her UNK-294 UNK-47 
 on another the cause of many UNK-265 between still attractive 
 married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men no doubt as 
 several famous cases of UNK-95 UNK-502 proved up to the UNK-172 . 
 UNK-0 
 it was a thousand UNK-361 a young fellow blessed with an allowance of 
 UNK-439 as his UNK-379 obviously was should waste his valuable time 
 with UNK-864 women who might present him with a nice dose to last him 
 his lifetime . in the nature of single UNK-833 he would one day take 
 unto himself a wife when miss right came on the scene but in the interim 
 ladies society was a UNK-628 UNK-972 UNK-219 non though he had the UNK-91 
 possible UNK-507 not that he wanted in the smallest to pump stephen 
 about miss UNK-893 who was very possibly the particular UNK-714 who 
 brought him down to UNK-736 so early in the morning as to whether he 
 would find much satisfaction UNK-348 in the boy and girl UNK-345 idea 
 and the company of UNK-413 UNK-65 without a penny to their names bi or 
 UNK-42 with the UNK-40 preliminary UNK-359 of UNK-979 and 
 walking out leading up to UNK-345 lovers ways and flowers and UNK-687 . to 
 think of him house and homeless UNK-48 by some UNK-593 worse than any 
 UNK-564 was really too bad at his age . the UNK-81 suddenly things 
 he UNK-388 out with UNK-57 the elder man who was several years the 
 others senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly 
 ought to eat even were it only an UNK-34 made on UNK-412 UNK-562 
 UNK-327 or failing that the UNK-393 UNK-424 UNK-970 UNK-631 . 
 UNK-0 
 at what UNK-270 did you UNK-815 ? he UNK-679 of the slim form and tired 
 though UNK-130 face . 
 UNK-0 
 some time yesterday stephen said . 
 UNK-0 
 yesterday ! UNK-751 bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow 
 friday . ah you mean its after twelve ! 
 UNK-0 
 the day before yesterday stephen said improving on himself . 
 UNK-0 
 literally UNK-22 at this piece of intelligence bloom reflected . 
 though they UNK-3 see eye to eye in everything a certain UNK-895 there 
 somehow was as if both their minds were travelling so to speak in the 
 one train of thought . at his age when UNK-17 in politics roughly 
 some score of years previously when he had been a UNK-440 UNK-730 to 
 parliamentary UNK-42 in the UNK-68 foster days he too UNK-738 in 
 UNK-102 which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself he had 
 a UNK-101 regard for those same ultra ideas . for instance when the 
 UNK-872 UNK-572 question then at its first UNK-653 UNK-580 largely in 
 peoples mind though it goes without saying not contributing a copper 
 or UNK-855 his faith absolutely to its UNK-34 some of which UNK-9 
 exactly hold water he at the UNK-90 in principle at all events was in 
 thorough sympathy with UNK-720 possession as UNK-308 the trend of modern 
 opinion a UNK-320 however which UNK-682 his mistake he was 
 subsequently partially UNK-514 of and even was UNK-250 with going a 
 step UNK-199 than michael UNK-281 in the striking views he at one time 
 UNK-50 as a UNK-325 which was one reason he strongly 
 UNK-77 the UNK-683 put upon him in so UNK-389 a fashion by our 
 friend at the gathering of the UNK-876 in UNK-778 UNK-149 so that he 
 though often UNK-490 UNK-105 and the least UNK-72 of 
 UNK-919 be it repeated UNK-931 from his UNK-206 UNK-158 to give 
 him UNK-847 one in the UNK-804 though so far as politics 
 themselves were concerned he was only too conscious of the UNK-113 
 UNK-327 resulting from UNK-982 and displays of mutual UNK-189 
 and the UNK-736 and suffering it UNK-527 as a UNK-641 conclusion on 
 fine young UNK-13 UNK-430 destruction of the UNK-62 in a word . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-58 upon UNK-902 up the pros and cons getting on for one as it 
 was it was high time to be UNK-760 for the night . the UNK-864 was it 
 was a bit UNK-807 to bring him home as UNK-503 might possibly UNK-549 
 somebody having a UNK-933 of her own sometimes and UNK-514 the hash 
 UNK-537 as on the night he UNK-172 brought home a dog breed 
 unknown with a UNK-201 UNK-762 not that the cases were either identical or 
 the reverse though he had hurt his hand too to ontario terrace as he 
 very UNK-589 remembered having been there so to speak . on the 
 other hand it was UNK-537 far and away too late for the UNK-476 
 or UNK-884 suggestion so that he was in some UNK-812 as to which of 
 the two alternatives . everything pointed to the fact that it UNK-793 him 
 to UNK-761 himself to the full of the opportunity all things considered . 
 his initial impression was he was a shade UNK-340 or not over 
 UNK-213 but it grew on him UNK-274 . for one thing he UNK-476 what you 
 call jump at the idea if UNK-596 and what mostly worried him was 
 he UNK-3 know how to lead up to it or word it exactly UNK-885 he 
 did UNK-198 the proposal as it would afford him very great personal 
 pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some 
 UNK-116 if found suitable . at all events he wound up by UNK-924 
 UNK-897 for the UNK-239 UNK-935 UNK-490 a cup of UNK-138 UNK-323 and 
 a UNK-922 for the night plus the use of a rug or two and UNK-319 
 UNK-307 into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as 
 a UNK-550 on a UNK-131 he failed to UNK-680 any very vast amount of harm 
 in that always with the UNK-323 no UNK-6 of any sort was UNK-986 up . 
 a move had to be made because that merry old soul the UNK-18 
 in question who appeared to be UNK-290 to the spot UNK-3 appear in any 
 particular UNK-282 to UNK-708 his way home to his UNK-383 UNK-506 UNK-74 
 and it was highly likely some UNK-443 UNK-414 of retired UNK-402 
 where age was no bar off sheriff street lower would be the best UNK-348 
 to that UNK-603 characters UNK-967 for a few days to come 
 UNK-101 UNK-223 their feelings the UNK-197 with UNK-526 
 UNK-283 UNK-603 UNK-33 on the tropical calculated to freeze 
 the UNK-729 of UNK-536 bones and UNK-540 their UNK-554 charms 
 UNK-859 with rough and UNK-553 UNK-792 to the UNK-621 of large 
 UNK-706 of UNK-701 and the usual UNK-922 about himself for as to who 
 he in reality was let x equal my right name and address as mr algebra 
 remarks UNK-520 . at the same time he UNK-547 UNK-468 over his gentle 
 UNK-280 to the blood and UNK-697 champion about his god being a UNK-181 . 
 people could put up with being UNK-696 by a wolf but what properly UNK-236 
 them was a bite from a sheep . the most vulnerable point too of tender 
 UNK-617 . your god was a UNK-181 . because mostly they appeared to imagine he 
 came from UNK-605 or UNK-123 in the county UNK-865 . 
 UNK-0 
 i propose our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while 
 UNK-411 UNK-227 her photo as its rather UNK-914 here you just come 
 home with me and talk things over . my UNK-55 are quite close in the 
 UNK-781 . you cant drink that stuff . do you like UNK-323 ? wait . ill just 
 pay this lot . 
 UNK-0 
 the best plan clearly being to clear out the remainder being plain 
 sailing he UNK-53 while UNK-411 UNK-227 the photo to the UNK-430 
 of the UNK-853 who UNK-3 seem to . 
 UNK-0 
 yes thats the best he assured stephen to whom for the matter of 
 that UNK-271 head or him or anywhere else was all more or less . 
 UNK-0 
 all kinds of UNK-187 plans were flashing through his bs busy brain 
 education the genuine article literature journalism prize UNK-313 
 up to date billing concert tours in english UNK-280 resorts packed 
 with UNK-15 and UNK-652 UNK-667 turning money away UNK-132 in italian 
 with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other 
 things no necessity of course to tell the world and his wife from the 
 UNK-502 about it and a UNK-676 of luck . an opening was all was wanted . 
 because he more than suspected he had his fathers voice to bank his 
 hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as 
 well by the way no harm to trail the conversation in the direction of 
 that particular red UNK-136 just to . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-821 read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former 
 UNK-30 earl UNK-930 had UNK-448 at the UNK-585 association 
 dinner in london somewhere . silence with a UNK-83 or two accompanied this 
 UNK-772 announcement . then the old UNK-540 in the corner who appeared 
 to have some UNK-125 of UNK-880 left read out that sir anthony UNK-884 
 had left UNK-396 for the chief UNK-461 lodge or words to that effect . 
 to which UNK-277 piece of intelligence echo answered why . 
 UNK-0 
 give us a UNK-133 at that literature UNK-423 the ancient UNK-542 
 put in UNK-318 some natural UNK-70 . 
 UNK-0 
 and welcome answered the elderly party thus addressed . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-99 UNK-269 out from a case he had a pair of UNK-253 UNK-825 
 which he very slowly UNK-845 over his nose and both ears . 
 UNK-0 
 are you bad in the eyes ? the UNK-333 UNK-726 like the UNK-176 
 UNK-426 . 
 UNK-0 
 why answered the UNK-478 with the UNK-685 UNK-153 who UNK-98 was 
 a bit of a literary cove in his own small way UNK-151 out of UNK-262 
 UNK-639 as you might well describe them as i uses UNK-825 reading . 
 sand in the red sea done that . one time i could read a book in the dark 
 manner of speaking . the UNK-392 nights entertainment was my favourite 
 and red as a rose is she . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-124 he UNK-438 the journal open and UNK-162 upon lord only knows what 
 found UNK-69 or the UNK-88 of king willow UNK-696 having made a 
 hundred and something second UNK-786 not out for UNK-556 during which 
 time completely regardless of UNK-99 the UNK-430 was UNK-112 occupied 
 UNK-152 an apparently new or UNK-674 boot which UNK-403 UNK-53 
 him as he UNK-606 against UNK-862 it was sold it all of them who were 
 sufficiently UNK-340 enough to be picked out by their facial expressions 
 that is to say either simply looking on UNK-556 or passing a UNK-168 
 remark . 
 UNK-0 
 to cut a long story short bloom UNK-559 the situation was the first 
 to rise from his seat so as not to UNK-581 their welcome having first 
 and UNK-533 being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for 
 the occasion taken the wise UNK-11 to UNK-438 motion to mine 
 host as a UNK-370 shot a UNK-253 UNK-352 sign when the others were 
 not looking to the effect that the amount due was UNK-652 making a 
 grand total of UNK-511 the amount he UNK-518 UNK-438 in 
 four UNK-526 literally the last of the UNK-156 he having previously 
 UNK-305 on the printed UNK-295 for all who ran to read opposite him 
 in UNK-844 figures coffee UNK-197 UNK-134 do and UNK-751 well 
 worth twice the money once in a way as UNK-168 used to remark . 
 UNK-0 
 come he UNK-728 to close the UNK-767 . 
 UNK-0 
 seeing that the UNK-814 worked and the coast was clear they left the 
 shelter or UNK-853 together and the lite society of UNK-677 and 
 company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their 
 UNK-796 far UNK-543 . stephen who UNK-964 to still feeling UNK-291 and 
 UNK-986 out UNK-214 at the for a moment the door . 
 UNK-0 
 one thing i never understood he said to be original on the UNK-686 of 
 the moment . why they put tables UNK-291 down at night i mean chairs 
 UNK-291 down on the tables in UNK-25 . to which UNK-795 the UNK-661 
 bloom replied without a moments UNK-989 saying straight off 
 UNK-0 
 to UNK-407 the floor in the morning . 
 UNK-0 
 so saying he UNK-92 around UNK-901 considering UNK-846 at the same 
 time UNK-228 to get on his UNK-193 right a UNK-158 of his by the 
 bye his right side being in classical UNK-267 his tender UNK-617 . the 
 night air was certainly now a treat to UNK-820 though stephen was a bit 
 weak on his pins . 
 UNK-0 
 it will the air do you good bloom said meaning also the walk in 
 a moment . the only thing is to walk then UNK-85 feel a different man . 
 come . its not far . lean on me . 
 UNK-0 
 accordingly he passed his left arm in UNK-8 right and led him on 
 accordingly . 
 UNK-0 
 yes stephen said UNK-971 because he thought he felt a strange 
 kind of flesh of a different man approach him UNK-282 and UNK-279 and 
 all that . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-58 they passed the UNK-795 with stones UNK-59 etc . where 
 the municipal UNK-780 ex UNK-446 was still to all UNK-409 and 
 purposes wrapped in the arms of murphy as the UNK-87 has it UNK-202 
 of fresh fields and UNK-264 new . and UNK-334 of UNK-142 of stones the 
 UNK-895 was not at all bad as it was in fact a UNK-653 to death on the 
 part of UNK-75 out of UNK-195 odd UNK-812 that UNK-778 at the 
 time of the split and UNK-430 the UNK-133 UNK-720 class probably the 
 UNK-595 UNK-872 UNK-572 he had put in their holdings . 
 UNK-0 
 so they turned on to UNK-176 about music a form of art for which 
 bloom as a pure amateur UNK-845 the greatest love as they made 
 tracks arm in arm across UNK-912 place . UNK-604 music though 
 UNK-79 grand in its way was a bit too heavy for bloom and hard to 
 follow at the first UNK-236 but the music of UNK-219 UNK-823 
 UNK-931 seven last words on the cross and UNK-225 UNK-347 mass 
 he simply UNK-932 in the UNK-841 in that being to his mind the UNK-975 
 of first class music as such literally UNK-800 everything else into 
 a UNK-786 hat . he UNK-145 preferred the sacred music of the catholic 
 church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as 
 those UNK-712 and UNK-610 UNK-275 or bid me to live and i will live 
 thy UNK-560 to be . he also UNK-941 to none in his UNK-870 of 
 UNK-430 UNK-433 UNK-56 a work simply UNK-923 in UNK-605 numbers 
 in which his wife UNK-280 marion UNK-267 made a hit a UNK-200 
 UNK-393 he might safely say greatly adding to her other UNK-517 and 
 putting the others totally in the shade in the UNK-249 fathers church 
 in upper UNK-914 street the sacred UNK-6 being UNK-614 to the 
 doors to hear her with UNK-264 or UNK-915 rather . there was the 
 UNK-420 opinion that there was none to come up to her and UNK-207 it 
 to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was 
 a generally UNK-826 desire for an UNK-951 . on the whole though UNK-820 
 UNK-82 light opera of the don UNK-104 description and martha 
 a gem in its line he had a UNK-323 though with only a surface 
 knowledge for the severe classical school such as UNK-88 . and 
 talking of that taking it for granted he knew all about the old 
 favourites he mentioned par excellence UNK-918 air in martha 
 UNK-292 which UNK-873 enough he had heard or UNK-196 to be 
 more accurate on yesterday a privilege he UNK-345 appreciated from the 
 lips of UNK-8 respected father UNK-903 to UNK-210 a study of the 
 number in fact which made all the others take a back seat . stephen in 
 reply to a UNK-269 put query said he UNK-3 sing it but launched 
 out into UNK-383 of UNK-892 songs at least of in or about that 
 period the UNK-963 UNK-625 who lived in UNK-223 lane near UNK-48 the 
 UNK-68 who UNK-664 UNK-836 UNK-348 UNK-781 an instrument he was 
 UNK-645 purchasing from mr arnold UNK-908 whom b . did not quite 
 recall though the name certainly UNK-224 familiar for UNK-245 UNK-472 
 and UNK-35 and son with their UNK-603 and comes UNK-127 and UNK-504 
 william who played the UNK-161 he said in the queens chapel or 
 anywhere else he found them and one UNK-81 who made toys or UNK-883 and 
 john bull . 
 UNK-0 
 on the UNK-992 which they were UNK-781 whilst still speaking beyond 
 the UNK-547 a horse UNK-873 a UNK-787 UNK-771 on the UNK-403 ground 
 UNK-751 a long UNK-944 of UNK-417 up so that with the noise bloom was not 
 perfectly certain whether he had caught UNK-805 the UNK-858 to UNK-245 
 UNK-472 and john bull . he UNK-388 if it was john bull the political 
 celebrity of that UNK-391 as it struck him the two identical names as a 
 striking UNK-780 . 
 UNK-0 
 by the chains the horse slowly UNK-545 to turn which UNK-491 bloom 
 who was keeping a sharp UNK-369 as usual UNK-347 the others sleeve 
 gently UNK-979 UNK-808 
 UNK-0 
 our lives are in UNK-711 tonight . UNK-974 of the UNK-298 . 
 UNK-0 
 they UNK-318 stopped . bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth 
 anything like UNK-245 UNK-472 suddenly in evidence in the dark quite 
 near so that it seemed new a different UNK-489 of bones and even flesh 
 because UNK-840 it was a UNK-931 a UNK-565 a UNK-857 a 
 UNK-814 a UNK-532 putting his UNK-511 foot UNK-533 the while the 
 lord of his creation sat on the UNK-925 busy with his thoughts . but such 
 a good poor UNK-64 he was sorry he UNK-180 a UNK-594 of sugar but as he 
 UNK-861 reflected you could UNK-253 be prepared for every emergency 
 that might crop up . he was just a big nervous UNK-735 UNK-846 kind of a 
 horse without a second care in the world . but even a dog he reflected 
 take that UNK-151 in UNK-778 UNK-149 of the same size would be a holy 
 horror to face . but it was no animals fault in particular if he was 
 built that way like the camel ship of the desert UNK-312 UNK-712 
 into UNK-701 in his UNK-604 . nine UNK-994 of them all could be UNK-605 or 
 trained nothing beyond the art of man UNK-782 the UNK-652 . whale with a 
 UNK-268 UNK-322 UNK-559 UNK-569 the small of his back and he sees the 
 joke UNK-140 a circle for a UNK-994 tiger my eagle eye . these timely 
 reflections UNK-15 the UNK-948 of the field occupied his mind somewhat 
 UNK-448 from UNK-8 words while the ship of the street was 
 UNK-24 and stephen went on about the highly interesting old . 
 UNK-0 
 whats this i was saying ? ah yes ! my wife he UNK-832 UNK-655 
 in UNK-956 res would have the greatest of pleasure in making your 
 UNK-930 as she is UNK-311 attached to music of any kind . 
 UNK-0 
 he looked UNK-174 in a friendly fashion at the UNK-961 of stephen 
 image of his mother which was not quite the same as the usual UNK-218 
 UNK-273 type they UNK-753 had an UNK-912 UNK-316 after as 
 he was perhaps not that way built . 
 UNK-0 
 still UNK-885 he had his fathers gift as he more than suspected 
 it opened up new UNK-749 in his mind such as lady UNK-921 irish 
 industries concert on the preceding monday and UNK-811 in general . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-32 variations he was now describing on an air youth here has 
 end by UNK-981 UNK-925 UNK-361 a UNK-889 of amsterdam where the UNK-700 
 come from . even more he liked an old german song of UNK-483 jeep 
 about the clear sea and the voices of UNK-774 sweet UNK-316 of men 
 which UNK-246 bloom a bit 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 von der UNK-468 UNK-553 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 UNK-887 die UNK-691 UNK-698 . 
 UNK-0 
 these opening bars he UNK-57 and translated UNK-288 . bloom UNK-278 
 said he perfectly understood and UNK-113 him to go on by all means which 
 he did . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-152 beautiful UNK-228 voice like that the UNK-388 of UNK-668 
 which bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out could easily 
 if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production 
 such as UNK-539 and being able to read music into the bargain 
 command its own price where UNK-229 were ten a penny and UNK-338 for 
 its UNK-460 UNK-211 in the near future an UNK-5 into UNK-500 
 houses in the best residential quarters of financial UNK-722 in a large 
 way of business and titled people where with his university degree of 
 b . a . a huge ad in its way and UNK-427 bearing to all the more 
 influence the good impression he would UNK-887 score a distinct 
 success being blessed with UNK-439 which also could be UNK-664 for the 
 purpose and other UNK-125 if his clothes were properly attended 
 to so as to the better worm his way into their good UNK-799 as he a 
 UNK-405 UNK-415 UNK-211 UNK-701 UNK-764 hardly understood how a 
 little thing like that could UNK-844 against you . it was in fact only a 
 matter of months and he could easily UNK-189 him participating in their 
 musical and artistic UNK-317 during the UNK-62 of the 
 christmas season for choice causing a slight UNK-782 in the UNK-522 
 of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for UNK-393 
 cases of which as he happened to know were on UNK-386 fact without 
 giving the show away he himself once upon a time if he UNK-394 to could 
 easily have . added to which of course would be the UNK-116 UNK-405 
 by no means to be UNK-901 at going hand in hand with his tuition 
 fees . not he UNK-862 that for the sake of UNK-947 UNK-190 he need 
 necessarily UNK-73 the lyric platform as a walk in life for any UNK-480 
 space of time . but a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or 
 UNK-376 and both UNK-827 and UNK-908 it contained no reflection on his 
 UNK-491 in the smallest and it often turned in UNK-810 handy to 
 be handed a cheque at a UNK-468 moment when every little helped . 
 besides though taste UNK-125 had UNK-700 to a degree original 
 music like that different from the conventional UNK-351 would rapidly 
 have a great UNK-300 as it would be a decided novelty for UNK-630 musical 
 world after the usual UNK-565 run of UNK-241 UNK-228 UNK-486 UNK-340 on a 
 UNK-512 public by UNK-551 st UNK-268 and hilton st just and their UNK-651 
 UNK-309 . yes beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in 
 his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win 
 a high place in the UNK-89 UNK-139 where he could command a UNK-257 figure 
 and booking ahead give a grand concert for the UNK-62 of the king 
 street house given a UNK-651 if one were UNK-652 to kick him 
 UNK-316 so to speak a big if however with some UNK-466 of the 
 UNK-574 sort to UNK-674 the UNK-261 UNK-956 which often 
 UNK-182 a too much UNK-587 prince of good UNK-13 . and it need not 
 UNK-669 from the other by one UNK-433 as being his own master he would 
 have UNK-436 of time to UNK-349 literature in his spare moments when 
 UNK-242 of so doing without its UNK-508 with his vocal career or 
 containing anything UNK-386 UNK-303 as it was a matter for himself 
 alone . in fact he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason 
 why the other UNK-845 of a UNK-56 sharp nose for UNK-749 a rat 
 of any sort hung on to him at all . 
 UNK-0 
 the horse was just then . and later on at a UNK-660 opportunity he 
 UNK-493 bloom did without anyway UNK-405 into his private affairs on 
 the UNK-972 step in where angels principle UNK-958 him to UNK-426 his 
 connection with a certain UNK-346 practitioner who he noticed was 
 UNK-805 to UNK-881 and even to a slight extent with some UNK-796 
 UNK-697 when not present UNK-944 him or whatever you like to call it 
 which in UNK-34 UNK-369 opinion UNK-163 a nasty UNK-375 on that side of 
 a persons character no UNK-890 intended . 
 UNK-0 
 the horse having reached the end of his UNK-140 so to speak UNK-46 and 
 UNK-614 high a proud UNK-336 tail added his UNK-641 by letting fall on 
 the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish three smoking 
 UNK-636 of UNK-308 . slowly three times one after another from a full 
 UNK-287 he UNK-960 . and UNK-934 his driver UNK-56 till he or she had 
 ended patient in his UNK-55 car . 
 UNK-0 
 side by side bloom UNK-796 by the UNK-688 with stephen passed 
 through the gap of the chains divided by the UNK-539 and UNK-764 
 over a strand of UNK-417 went across towards UNK-914 street lower 
 stephen singing more UNK-258 but not UNK-76 the end of the UNK-45 . 
 UNK-0 
 und UNK-537 UNK-451 UNK-223 . 
 UNK-0 
 the driver never said a word good bad or UNK-942 but merely 
 watched the two figures as he sat on his UNK-115 car both black 
 one full one lean walk towards the railway bridge to be married by 
 father UNK-492 . as they walked they at times stopped and walked again 
 continuing their UNK-614 which of course he was UNK-944 out 
 of about UNK-774 enemies of UNK-54 reason UNK-907 with a number of other 
 topics of the same category UNK-466 historical cases of the kind 
 while the man in the UNK-787 car or you might as well call it in the 
 UNK-565 car who in any case UNK-18 possibly hear because they were too 
 far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower UNK-914 street and 
 looked after their UNK-115 car . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 what parallel courses did bloom and stephen follow returning ? 
 UNK-0 
 starting united both at normal walking pace from UNK-912 place they 
 followed in the order named lower and middle UNK-914 streets and 
 UNK-785 square west then at reduced pace each bearing left 
 UNK-389 place by an UNK-152 as far as the UNK-199 corner of 
 temple street then at reduced pace with UNK-168 of UNK-74 bearing 
 right temple street north as far as UNK-797 place . UNK-781 
 UNK-932 at UNK-761 walking pace they UNK-112 both the circus before 
 UNK-528 church UNK-609 the UNK-774 in any circle being less than

 did bloom discover common factors of UNK-188 between their respective 
 like and unlike reactions to experience ? 
 UNK-0 
 both were sensitive to artistic UNK-539 musical in preference to 
 plastic or UNK-393 . both preferred a continental to an UNK-259 manner 
 of life a UNK-201 to a UNK-105 place of residence . both 
 UNK-810 by early domestic training and an inherited UNK-173 of 
 UNK-879 resistance UNK-761 their UNK-258 in many UNK-40 
 religious national social and ethical UNK-713 . both admitted 
 the UNK-101 UNK-386 and UNK-87 influence of UNK-663 
 UNK-509 .

 UNK-768 and UNK-819 strength UNK-935 by mental UNK-641 and 
 the velocity of rapid circular motion in a UNK-388 atmosphere stephen 
 UNK-153 to the UNK-843 of a UNK-887 cloud perceived by both 
 from two different points of observation UNK-884 and dublin at first 
 no bigger than a UNK-95 hand .

 UNK-0 
 what reflection concerning the UNK-167 sequence of dates UNK-41 UNK-112 
 UNK-86 UNK-919 UNK-219 UNK-463 UNK-506 did bloom make before their arrival at 
 their destination ? 
 UNK-0 
 he reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual 
 development and experience was UNK-950 accompanied by a restriction 
 of the UNK-401 domain of UNK-565 relations . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 as in what ways ? 
 UNK-0 
 from UNK-928 to existence he came to many and was as one received

 UNK-0 
 was it there ? 
 UNK-0 
 it was in the corresponding pocket of the UNK-48 which he had worn on 
 the day but one preceding . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 why was he UNK-528 UNK-120 ? 
 UNK-0 
 because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had UNK-610 
 himself twice not to forget . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0

 respectively and UNK-445 UNK-250 couple ?

 the lower union of UNK-592 and UNK-576 UNK-42 his body gradually by its 
 length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches 
 of the area UNK-125 and allowed his body to move freely in space by 
 UNK-642 himself from the UNK-321 and UNK-625 in preparation for 
 the impact of the fall . 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 what discrete UNK-141 of images did stephen meanwhile UNK-680 ? 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 of others elsewhere in other times who UNK-755 on one knee or on two

 progress were carried far enough UNK-527 nowhere was never reached . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 why did he not UNK-896 these calculations to a more precise result ? 
 UNK-0 
 because some years previously in UNK-86 when occupied with the problem 
 of the UNK-567 of the circle he had learned of the existence of a 
 number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude 
 and of so many places e UNK-771 . the UNK-462 power of the UNK-462 power of UNK-434 that 
 the result having been obtained UNK-946 closely printed volumes of UNK-900 
 pages each of UNK-304 UNK-392 and UNK-60 of india paper would have to 
 be UNK-568 in order to contain the complete tale of its printed 
 UNK-555 of units UNK-365 hundreds thousands UNK-365 of thousands 
 hundreds of thousands millions UNK-365 of millions hundreds of millions 
 UNK-687 the UNK-687 of the UNK-929 of every digit of every series 
 containing UNK-463 the UNK-92 of being raised to the UNK-881 
 UNK-229 UNK-653 of any power of any of its powers . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 did he find the problems of the UNK-169 of the planets and their 
 UNK-443 by a race given in species and of the possible social and 
 moral UNK-508 of said race by a UNK-890 easier of solution ? 
 UNK-0 
 of a different order of difficulty . conscious that the human UNK-578 
 normally capable of UNK-587 an atmospheric pressure of UNK-227 tons 
 when UNK-779 to a considerable UNK-561 in the UNK-415 atmosphere 
 suffered with UNK-672 UNK-455 of intensity according as 
 the line of UNK-417 between UNK-257 and UNK-829 was 
 UNK-947 from UNK-116 UNK-734 UNK-902 UNK-195 and UNK-684 
 when UNK-564 this problem for solution he had UNK-814 as a 
 working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more 
 UNK-606 and differently UNK-131 constructed race of beings might 
 UNK-766 otherwise under UNK-506 UNK-325 UNK-879 UNK-871 UNK-280 
 UNK-116 or UNK-52 sufficient and equivalent conditions though 
 an UNK-628 humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite 
 differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would 
 probably there as here remain UNK-445 and UNK-624 attached to 
 UNK-136 to UNK-136 of UNK-136 and to all that is UNK-385 .

 his UNK-34 logical conclusion having UNK-441 the matter and allowing 
 for possible error ? 
 UNK-0 
 that it was not a UNK-226 not a UNK-118 not a UNK-663 not 
 a UNK-930 . that it was a UNK-630 there being no known method from 
 the known to the unknown an UNK-789 UNK-569 equally finite by the 
 UNK-367 UNK-923 of one or more bodies equally of the same and of 
 different UNK-272 a mobility of UNK-816 forms UNK-843 in space 
 UNK-532 in air a past which possibly had UNK-167 to exist as a 
 present before its UNK-757 UNK-9 had entered actual present 
 existence . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 was he more convinced of the UNK-175 value of the UNK-876 ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-763 in consequence of the UNK-748 examples of UNK-485 in the 
 UNK-962 of the UNK-956 of attachment or in the UNK-851 of UNK-719 
 UNK-773 UNK-452 UNK-333 UNK-245 or the UNK-138 of the

 UNK-0 
 did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of UNK-206 
 influences upon UNK-600 UNK-947 ?

 UNK-892 employed in its UNK-995 charts as UNK-727 to

 because a nature full and UNK-252 in its free state was UNK-101

 UNK-0 
 going to dark bed there was a square round UNK-472 the UNK-99 UNK-185 UNK-413 
 egg in the night of the bed of all the UNK-413 of the UNK-185 of UNK-715 the 
 UNK-343 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 where ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his 
 breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the city arms hotel 
 when he used to be UNK-438 to be laid up with a sick voice doing his 
 UNK-514 to make himself interesting for that old UNK-287 mrs UNK-577 
 that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a UNK-407 
 all for UNK-152 for herself and her soul greatest UNK-760 ever was actually 
 afraid to lay out UNK-627 for her UNK-620 spirit telling me all her 
 UNK-137 she had too much old chat in her about politics and UNK-197 
 and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first god help the 
 world if all the women were her sort down on UNK-532 and UNK-740 
 of course nobody wanted her to wear them i suppose she was UNK-290 because 
 no man would look at her twice i hope ill never be like her a wonder 
 she UNK-3 want us to cover our faces but she was a UNK-914 woman 
 certainly and her UNK-953 talk about mr UNK-577 here and mr UNK-577 there 
 i suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog UNK-749 my fur and 
 always UNK-749 to get up under my UNK-966 especially then still i like 
 that in him UNK-727 to old women like that and UNK-862 and UNK-228 too 
 UNK-2 not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything 
 really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into 
 a hospital where everything is clean but i suppose id have to UNK-302 it 
 into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing 
 on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a UNK-642 
 maybe like the UNK-935 photo he has UNK-23 as much a UNK-642 as im not yes 
 because UNK-30 so weak and UNK-131 when UNK-30 sick they want a woman 
 to get well if his nose UNK-540 UNK-306 think it was o UNK-472 and that 
 UNK-365 one off the south circular when he UNK-76 his foot at 
 the choir party at the UNK-986 mountain the day i UNK-71 that dress 
 miss stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the 
 bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a UNK-54 bedroom with 
 her old UNK-893 voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to 
 never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his UNK-153 
 a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides i hate UNK-248 and 
 UNK-175 when he cut his toe with the UNK-949 UNK-537 his UNK-710 afraid UNK-25 
 get UNK-746 but if it was a thing i was sick then wed see what 
 attention only of course the woman UNK-77 it not to give all the trouble 
 they do yes he came somewhere im sure by his UNK-437 anyway love its 
 not or UNK-25 be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those 
 night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he 
 made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it UNK-45 kept me who did i 
 meet ah yes i met do you remember UNK-311 and who else who let me see 
 that big UNK-497 i saw him and he not long married UNK-278 with a 
 young girl at UNK-165 UNK-623 and turned my back on him when he UNK-223 
 out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the UNK-387 to make 
 up to me one time well done to him mouth UNK-783 and his UNK-631 eyes of 
 all the big UNK-578 i ever met and thats called a UNK-698 only for 
 i hate having a long UNK-239 in bed or else if its not that its some 
 little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the 
 UNK-147 if they only knew him as well as i do yes because the day before 
 yesterday he was UNK-53 something a letter when i came into the 
 front room to show him UNK-707 death in the paper as if something told 
 me and he covered it up with the UNK-218 UNK-438 to be thinking 
 about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks 
 she has a UNK-938 in him because all men get a bit like that at his age 
 especially getting on to forty he is now so as to UNK-546 any money she 
 can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my 
 bottom was to hide it not that i care two UNK-378 now who he does it with 
 or knew before that way though id like to find out so long as i dont 
 have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that mary 
 we had in ontario terrace UNK-865 out her false bottom to UNK-333 him bad 
 enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice 
 i had a UNK-488 by getting him to come near me when i found the 
 long hair on his coat without that one when i went into the kitchen 
 UNK-438 he was drinking water UNK-74 woman is not enough for them it was 
 all his fault of course UNK-507 UNK-478 then UNK-564 that she could 
 eat at our table on christmas day if you please o no thank you not in my 
 house UNK-511 my potatoes and the UNK-791 UNK-195 per UNK-110 going out to see 
 her UNK-7 if you please common UNK-769 so it was but i was sure he had 
 something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he 
 said you have no proof it was her proof o yes her UNK-7 was very UNK-345 of 
 UNK-791 but i told her what i thought of her suggesting me to go out to 
 be alone with her i UNK-9 lower myself to spy on them the UNK-900 i 
 found in her room the friday she was out that was enough for me a little 
 bit too much her face UNK-641 up on her with UNK-933 when i gave her her 
 weeks notice i saw to that better do without them UNK-537 do out the 
 rooms myself UNK-496 only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt 
 i gave it to him UNK-58 either she or me leaves the house i UNK-18 even 
 touch him if i thought he was with a dirty UNK-389 UNK-328 and UNK-108 
 like that one UNK-209 it up to my face and singing about the place in 
 the w c too because she knew she was too well off yes because he UNK-18 
 possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last 
 time he came on my bottom when was it the night UNK-43 gave my hand a 
 great UNK-139 going along by the UNK-27 in my hand there UNK-386 another 
 i just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to UNK-139 back 
 singing the young may moon UNK-23 UNK-101 love because he has an idea 
 about him and me UNK-2 not such a fool he said im dining out and going to 
 the UNK-671 though im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case 
 god knows UNK-2 a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the 
 same old hat unless i paid some UNK-566 boy to do it since i cant do 
 it myself a young boy would like me id UNK-971 him a little alone with 
 him if we were id let him see my UNK-900 the new ones and make him turn 
 red looking at him UNK-8 him i know what boys feel with that down 
 on their UNK-139 doing that UNK-253 drawing out the thing by the hour 
 question and answer would you do this that and the other with the 
 UNK-125 yes with a bishop yes i would because i told him about some dean 
 or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews UNK-97 gardens when i was 
 knitting that UNK-846 thing a stranger to dublin what place was it and 
 so on about the UNK-152 and he tired me out with UNK-848 encouraging 
 him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are 
 you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german 
 emperor is it yes imagine im him think of him can you feel him trying to 
 make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this 
 age of his life simply UNK-420 for any woman and no satisfaction in it 
 UNK-438 to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway 
 and it makes your lips pale UNK-58 its done now once and for all with 
 all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time 
 after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why 
 cant you kiss a man without going and UNK-244 him first you sometimes 
 love to UNK-659 when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help 
 yourself i wish some man or other would take me UNK-121 when UNK-2 there 
 and kiss me in his arms UNK-6 nothing like a kiss long and hot down to 
 your soul almost UNK-964 you then i hate that UNK-343 when i used 
 to go to father UNK-371 he touched me father and what harm if he did 
 where and i said on the canal bank like a fool but UNK-967 on your 
 person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was 
 it where you sit down yes o lord UNK-18 he say bottom right out and 
 have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever 
 way he put it i forget no father and i always think of the real father 
 what did he want to know for when i already UNK-964 it to god he had 
 a nice fat hand the palm UNK-295 always i UNK-9 mind feeling it neither 
 would he id say by the UNK-459 in his UNK-492 i wonder did he know 
 me in the box i could see his face he UNK-18 see mine of course UNK-25 
 never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died UNK-30 
 lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man UNK-155 let alone 
 them id like to be UNK-448 by one in his UNK-272 and the smell of 
 UNK-402 off him like the pope besides UNK-6 no danger with a priest if 
 UNK-14 married UNK-2 too careful about himself then give something to h 
 h the pope for a UNK-934 i wonder was he satisfied with me one thing i 
 UNK-3 like his UNK-277 me behind going away so UNK-108 in the hall 
 though i UNK-20 im not a horse or an ass am i i suppose he was thinking 
 of his fathers i wonder is he UNK-340 thinking of me or UNK-202 am i in 
 it who gave him that flower he said he bought he UNK-616 of some kind of 
 drink not UNK-224 or UNK-98 or perhaps the UNK-734 kind of paste they stick 
 their bills up with some UNK-558 id like to sip those UNK-39 green 
 and yellow expensive drinks those UNK-346 UNK-498 drink with the 
 opera hats i UNK-561 once with my finger UNK-860 out of that american that 
 had the UNK-582 talking stamps with father he had all he could do to 
 keep himself from falling UNK-314 after the last time after we took the 
 port and UNK-945 meat it had a fine UNK-672 taste yes because i felt lovely 
 and tired myself and fell UNK-314 as sound as a top the moment i UNK-388 
 straight into bed till that thunder UNK-911 me up god be UNK-607 to us 
 i thought the UNK-100 were coming down about us to UNK-614 us when i 
 blessed myself and said a UNK-732 mary like those awful UNK-184 in 
 gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and 
 tell you UNK-6 no god what could you do if it was running and UNK-531 
 about nothing only make an act of UNK-256 the candle i lit that 
 evening in UNK-627 street chapel for the month of may see it brought 
 its luck though UNK-25 UNK-904 if he heard because he never goes to church 
 mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey 
 matter because he UNK-55 know what it is to have one yes when i lit the 
 lamp because he must have come UNK-225 or UNK-281 times with that tremendous big red 
 UNK-64 of a thing he has i thought the UNK-249 or whatever the UNK-684 they 
 call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after i took 
 off all my things with the UNK-418 down after my hours dressing and 
 UNK-716 and UNK-865 it like iron or some kind of a thick UNK-662 
 standing all the time he must have UNK-361 UNK-791 i think a few dozen he 
 was in great singing voice no i never in all my life felt anyone had 
 one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have UNK-361 a whole 
 sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the 
 middle of us or like a UNK-118 driving it up into you because thats all 
 they want out of you with that determined UNK-347 look in his eye i had 
 to UNK-238 my eyes still he UNK-696 such a tremendous amount of UNK-676 in 
 him when i made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is 
 so much the better in case any of it UNK-69 UNK-466 out properly the last 
 time i let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for 
 him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it 
 themselves UNK-492 know what i went through with UNK-127 nobody would 
 believe cutting her teeth too and UNK-312 UNK-70 husband give us a swing 
 out of your UNK-304 filling her up with a child or twins once a year 
 as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one 
 they called UNK-582 or something like a UNK-848 with a shock of hair on 
 it UNK-956 the child is a black the last time i was there a squad of 
 them falling over one another and UNK-159 you UNK-18 hear your ears 
 supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us UNK-672 out like 
 UNK-299 or i dont know what UNK-885 i UNK-689 having another not off 
 him though still if he was married im sure UNK-25 have a fine strong child 
 but i dont know UNK-262 has more UNK-676 in him yes UNK-112 be UNK-229 UNK-236 
 i suppose it was meeting UNK-414 powell and the funeral and thinking about 
 me and UNK-43 set him off well he can think what he likes now if UNK-397 
 do him any good i know they were UNK-947 a bit when i came on the scene 
 he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of UNK-450 simpsons 
 UNK-852 and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account 
 of not UNK-393 to see her a UNK-642 that was why we had the UNK-767 
 row over politics he began it not me when he said about our lord being a 
 UNK-431 at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about 
 everything i was UNK-942 with myself after for giving in only for i knew 
 he was gone on me and the first UNK-372 he said he was he UNK-776 me 
 so much i UNK-18 put him into a UNK-933 still he knows a lot of UNK-78 
 things especially about the body and the inside i often wanted to study 
 up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician i could 
 always hear his voice talking when the room was UNK-196 and watch him 
 after that i UNK-204 i had a UNK-480 on with her over him because he 
 used to be a bit on the UNK-528 side whenever he asked who are you going 
 to and i said over to UNK-490 and he made me the present of UNK-884 poems 
 and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that i could quite easily 
 get him to make it up any time i know how id even UNK-885 he got in 
 with her again and was going out to see her somewhere id know if he 
 refused to eat the UNK-538 i know plenty of ways ask him to UNK-273 down the 
 collar of my UNK-413 or touch him with my UNK-296 and gloves on going out i 
 kiss then would send them all UNK-785 however UNK-137 well see then let 
 him go to her she of course would only be too UNK-649 to UNK-883 UNK-23 
 mad in love with him that i UNK-9 so much mind id just go to her and 
 ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she UNK-18 fool 
 me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his 
 UNK-335 kind of a manner like he did to me though i had the UNK-268 own 
 job to get it out of him though i liked him for that it showed he could 
 hold in and UNK-69 to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking 
 me too the night in the kitchen i was rolling the potato cake UNK-6 
 something i want to say to you only for i put him off letting on i was 
 in a UNK-933 with my hands and arms full of UNK-983 flour in any case i let 
 out too much the night before talking of dreams so i UNK-3 want to let 
 him know more than was good for him she used to be always UNK-430 me 
 UNK-414 whenever he was there meaning him of course UNK-531 me over and 
 when i said i UNK-466 up and down as far as possible asking me and did 
 you wash possible the women are always UNK-133 on to that putting it on 
 thick when UNK-2 there they know by his UNK-147 eye UNK-717 a bit putting on 
 the UNK-942 when they come out with something the kind he is what 
 UNK-66 him i dont wonder in the least because he was very UNK-218 at 
 that time trying to look like lord UNK-172 i said i liked though he 
 was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged 
 afterwards though she UNK-3 like it so much the day i was in fits of 
 laughing with the UNK-638 i UNK-18 stop about all my UNK-716 falling 
 out one after another with the mass of hair i had UNK-14 always in great 
 UNK-179 she said yes because it UNK-851 her because she knew what it 
 meant because i used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us 
 not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that UNK-69 my fault 
 she UNK-3 UNK-704 the door much after we were married i wonder what UNK-23 
 got like now after living with that UNK-937 husband of UNK-349 she had her 
 face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time i saw her she 
 must have been just after a row with him because i saw on the moment she 
 was UNK-749 to draw down a conversation about UNK-624 and talk about him 
 to run him down what was it she told me o yes that sometimes he used to 
 go to bed with his UNK-249 boots on when the UNK-966 takes him just imagine 
 having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you 
 any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad UNK-262 
 UNK-58 whatever he does always UNK-126 his feet on the mat when he comes 
 in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes 
 off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now UNK-2 going 
 about in his UNK-193 to look for UNK-571 pounds for a postcard u p up 
 o UNK-495 may UNK-9 a thing like that simply UNK-135 you UNK-257 to 
 UNK-326 actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what 
 could you make of a man like that id rather die UNK-500 times over than UNK-454 
 another of their sex of course UNK-25 never find another woman like me to 
 put up with him the way i do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows 
 that too at the bottom of his heart take that mrs UNK-819 that UNK-470 
 her husband for what i wonder in love with some other man yes it was 
 found out on her UNK-69 she the UNK-576 UNK-904 to go and do a thing 
 like that of course some men can be UNK-441 UNK-287 drive you mad 
 and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to UNK-454 them 
 for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on 
 without us white UNK-864 she put in his tea off UNK-566 UNK-69 it i 
 wonder why they call it that if i asked him UNK-25 say its from the greek 
 leave us as wise as we were before she must have been UNK-878 in love with 
 the other fellow to run the chance of being UNK-681 o she UNK-3 care if 
 that was her nature what could she do besides UNK-30 not UNK-948 enough 
 to go and hang a woman surely are they 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-30 all so different UNK-43 talking about the shape of my foot he 
 noticed at once even before he was introduced when i was in the d b c 
 with UNK-262 laughing and trying to listen i was UNK-564 my foot we both 
 ordered UNK-67 UNK-383 and plain bread and butter i saw him looking with his 
 two old UNK-893 of sisters when i stood up and asked the girl where it was 
 what do i care with it UNK-794 out of me and that black closed UNK-468 
 he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down UNK-93 all 
 myself always with some UNK-930 UNK-646 every other week such a long one i 
 did i forgot my UNK-657 gloves on the seat behind that i never got after 
 some UNK-508 of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the irish times 
 lost in the ladies UNK-220 d b c dame street finder return to mrs 
 marion bloom and i saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning 
 door he was looking when i looked back and i went there for tea UNK-67 days 
 after in the hope but he UNK-69 now how did that UNK-333 him because i was 
 crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes 
 that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if i only had a 
 ring with the stone for my month a nice UNK-302 ill stick him for one 
 and a gold bracelet i dont like my foot so much still i made him spend 
 once with my foot the night after UNK-568 UNK-587 of a concert so cold 
 and UNK-922 it was well we had that UNK-647 in the house to UNK-564 and the fire 
 UNK-69 black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the 
 UNK-350 in UNK-860 street west and another time it was my UNK-249 boots 
 UNK-25 like me to walk in all the horses UNK-834 i could find but of course 
 UNK-2 not natural like the rest of the world that i what did he say i 
 could give UNK-434 points in UNK-503 to UNK-232 UNK-280 and beat her what does that 
 mean i asked him i forget what he said because the UNK-665 edition 
 just passed and the man with the UNK-693 hair in the UNK-822 dairy thats so 
 UNK-727 i think i saw his face before somewhere i noticed him when i was 
 UNK-377 the butter so i took my time UNK-334 UNK-184 too that he used to 
 make fun of when he UNK-304 kissing me on the choir UNK-93 after i 
 UNK-57 UNK-320 ave maria what are we waiting for o my heart kiss me 
 straight on the UNK-195 and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot 
 for all his UNK-515 voice too my low notes he was always UNK-222 about if 
 you can believe him i liked the way he used his mouth singing then he 
 said UNK-69 it terrible to do that there in a place like that i dont see 
 anything so terrible about it ill tell him about that some day not now 
 and surprise him UNK-42 and ill take him there and show him the very place 
 too we did it so now there you are like it or UNK-594 it he thinks nothing 
 can happen without him knowing he UNK-180 an idea about my mother till we 
 were engaged otherwise UNK-25 never have got me so cheap as he did he was 
 lo times worse himself UNK-58 UNK-301 me to give him a tiny bit cut off 
 my UNK-440 that was the evening coming along UNK-945 square he UNK-166 
 me in the eye of my UNK-516 and i had to take it off asking me questions 
 is it permitted to UNK-228 the shape of my bedroom so i let him keep it 
 as if i forgot it to think of me when i saw him slip it into his pocket 
 of course UNK-2 mad on the subject of UNK-440 thats plain to be seen 
 always UNK-264 at those UNK-148 things on the UNK-798 with their 
 skirts blowing up to their UNK-929 even when UNK-127 and i were out with 
 him at the open air UNK-477 that one in the cream UNK-769 standing right 
 against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me 
 from behind following in the rain i saw him before he saw me however 
 standing at the corner of the UNK-975 cross road with a new UNK-452 on 
 him with the UNK-540 in the UNK-930 colours to show off his UNK-691 
 and the brown hat looking UNK-706 as usual what was he doing there 
 where UNK-25 no business they can go and get whatever they like from 
 anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but 
 they want to know where were you where are you going i could feel him 
 coming along UNK-427 after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping 
 away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so i 
 UNK-47 and stopped then he UNK-555 me to say yes till i took off my 
 UNK-516 slowly watching him he said my UNK-285 UNK-552 were too cold for 
 the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand UNK-248 me UNK-440 drawers 
 the whole blessed time till i promised to give him the pair off my doll 
 to carry about in his UNK-187 pocket o maria UNK-292 he did look 
 a big fool UNK-451 in the rain UNK-288 set of teeth he had made me 
 hungry to look at them and UNK-774 of me to lift the orange UNK-470 
 i had on with the UNK-353 UNK-525 that there was nobody he said UNK-25 UNK-456 
 down in the wet if i UNK-3 so UNK-928 he would too and UNK-625 his new 
 UNK-452 you never know what UNK-781 UNK-492 take alone with you UNK-30 so 
 savage for it if anyone was passing so i UNK-64 them a bit and touched 
 his UNK-48 outside the way i used to UNK-701 after with my ring hand 
 to keep him from doing worse where it was too public i was dying to find 
 out was he UNK-196 he was UNK-144 like a UNK-325 all over they want 
 to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father 
 waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say i left my purse in 
 the UNK-754 and had to go back for it what a UNK-5 then he wrote me 
 that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any 
 woman after his company UNK-347 making it so UNK-795 after when we met 
 asking me have i UNK-563 you with my UNK-863 down of course he saw i 
 UNK-69 he had a few UNK-439 not like that other fool UNK-506 UNK-733 he was 
 always breaking or UNK-375 something in the UNK-916 i hate an UNK-715 
 man and if i knew what it meant of course i had to say no for form sake 
 dont understand you i said and UNK-69 it natural so it is of course 
 it used to be written up with a picture of a UNK-95 on that wall in 
 gibraltar with that word i UNK-18 find anywhere only for children 
 seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice 
 a day i liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman 
 when he sent me the UNK-701 big UNK-842 because mine was the UNK-896 then i wrote 
 the night he UNK-166 my heart at UNK-7 barn i UNK-18 describe it 
 simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to 
 UNK-73 well like UNK-701 i hope hell come on monday as he said at the 
 same time four i hate people who come at all hours answer the door you 
 think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all UNK-753 or 
 the door of the UNK-947 UNK-907 kitchen UNK-277 open the day old UNK-760 
 UNK-156 called about the concert in UNK-860 street and i just after 
 dinner all UNK-327 and UNK-481 with UNK-365 old UNK-773 dont look at me 
 professor i had to say im a UNK-512 yes but he was a real old UNK-469 in his 
 way it was impossible to be more UNK-202 nobody to say UNK-14 out you 
 have to UNK-105 out through the blind like the UNK-695 today i thought 
 it was a UNK-232 first him sending the port and the UNK-879 first and i 
 was just beginning to UNK-83 with UNK-510 thinking he was trying to make a 
 fool of me when i knew his UNK-627 at the door he must have been 
 a bit late because it was UNK-276 after UNK-225 when i saw the UNK-67 UNK-1 girls 
 coming from school i never know the time even that watch he gave me 
 never seems to go properly id want to get it looked after when i UNK-163 
 the penny to that UNK-201 UNK-99 for england home and beauty when i was 
 UNK-604 there is a charming girl i love and i UNK-180 even put on my 
 clean shift or UNK-239 myself or a thing then this day week were to go 
 to belfast just as well he has to go to UNK-844 his fathers anniversary 
 the UNK-850 it UNK-9 be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel 
 were beside each other and any UNK-237 went on in the new bed i UNK-18 
 tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps 
 some UNK-560 UNK-41 with a UNK-766 UNK-800 on the wall then UNK-25 
 never believe the next day we UNK-3 do something its all very well a 
 husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did 
 anything of course he UNK-3 believe me no its better UNK-2 going where 
 he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the 
 UNK-371 concert at UNK-357 ordering UNK-365 soup for the two of 
 us then the bell UNK-459 out he walks down the platform with the soup 
 UNK-372 about taking UNK-485 of it UNK-180 he the nerve and the UNK-738 
 after him making a holy show of us UNK-561 and confusion for the 
 engine to start but he UNK-9 pay till he finished it the two UNK-32 
 in the UNK-887 class UNK-114 said he was quite right so he was too UNK-2 so 
 UNK-550 sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was 
 able to open the UNK-114 door with his knife or UNK-492 have taken us on 
 to cork i suppose that was done out of revenge on him o i love UNK-92 
 in a train or a car with lovely soft UNK-973 i wonder will he take 
 a UNK-243 class for me he might want to do it in the train by UNK-842 the 
 guard well o i suppose UNK-63 be the usual UNK-407 of men UNK-775 at 
 us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an 
 exceptional man that common UNK-802 that left us alone in the UNK-114 
 that day going to UNK-301 id like to find out something about him l or UNK-67 
 UNK-564 perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the UNK-382 
 then coming back suppose i never came back what would they say UNK-703 
 with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert i UNK-57 at where 
 its over a year ago when was it st UNK-143 hall UNK-436 st little 
 UNK-101 of UNK-30 they have now singing UNK-464 UNK-63 and her like 
 on account of father being in the army and my singing the UNK-29 
 UNK-806 and wearing a UNK-813 for lord roberts when i had the map of it 
 all and UNK-262 not irish enough was it him managed it this time i UNK-9 
 put it past him like he got me on to sing in the UNK-433 UNK-56 by going 
 around saying he was putting lead UNK-320 light to music i put him up to 
 that till the UNK-517 found out he was a UNK-220 UNK-512 the piano 
 lead thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about 
 with some of them UNK-473 UNK-557 lately or whatever they call themselves 
 talking his usual trash and UNK-221 he says that little man he showed 
 me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man UNK-789 is he 
 well he UNK-55 look it thats all i can say still it must have been him 
 he knew there was a UNK-777 i hate the mention of their politics after 
 the war that UNK-988 and UNK-47 and UNK-852 where UNK-701 UNK-278 
 stanley g UNK-896 UNK-565 UNK-708 east UNK-146 UNK-618 of UNK-296 fever he was a lovely 
 fellow in UNK-227 and just the right height over me im sure he was brave 
 too he said i was lovely the evening we UNK-166 UNK-244 at the canal lock 
 my irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be 
 seen from the road he UNK-18 stand properly and i so hot as i never 
 felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old UNK-5 paul 
 and the rest of the other old UNK-251 go and fight it out between them 
 instead of UNK-873 on for years killing any UNK-722 men there were 
 with their fever if he was even UNK-750 shot it UNK-9 have been so 
 bad i love to see a UNK-673 pass in review the first time i saw the 
 spanish UNK-76 at la UNK-312 it was lovely after looking across the bay 
 from UNK-692 all the lights of the rock like UNK-746 or those UNK-352 
 UNK-602 on the UNK-704 acres the black watch with their UNK-24 in time at the 
 march past the UNK-566 UNK-911 the prince of wales own or the UNK-326 o the 
 UNK-326 UNK-30 grand or the UNK-630 that won UNK-384 his father made his 
 money over selling the horses for the UNK-76 well he could buy me a 
 nice present up in belfast after what i gave him UNK-67 lovely UNK-683 up 
 there or one of those nice UNK-39 things i must buy a UNK-104 like i 
 had before to keep in the UNK-877 with them it would be exciting going 
 round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave 
 this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the 
 UNK-187 there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or 
 tell the police on me but UNK-492 think were married o let them all go and 
 UNK-610 themselves for the fat lot i care he has plenty of money and UNK-2 
 not a UNK-244 man so somebody better get it out of him if i could find 
 out whether he likes me i looked a bit UNK-517 of course when i looked 
 close in the UNK-549 UNK-850 a mirror never gives you the expression 
 besides UNK-643 down on me like that all the time with his big 
 UNK-617 UNK-2 heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having 
 to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way 
 mrs UNK-288 told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and 
 stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild 
 with his UNK-76 UNK-648 can you ever be up to men the way it takes 
 them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks 
 with the UNK-87 silk things on them UNK-2 certainly well off i know by 
 the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect 
 devil for a few minutes after he came back with the UNK-665 UNK-375 up 
 the tickets and UNK-128 UNK-103 because he lost UNK-500 UNK-260 he said he lost 
 over that UNK-478 that won and half he put on for me on account of 
 UNK-612 tip UNK-683 him to the lowest UNK-312 that UNK-37 he was making 
 free with me after the UNK-355 dinner coming back that long UNK-19 over 
 the UNK-313 mountain after the lord mayor looking at me with his 
 dirty eyes val UNK-231 that big UNK-588 i first noticed him at UNK-367 
 when i was UNK-185 the nuts with my teeth i UNK-136 i could have picked 
 every UNK-817 of that chicken out of my fingers it was so UNK-109

 everything on my plate those UNK-689 and UNK-850 were UNK-172

 my UNK-621 when i was playing with them then always hanging out of them for 
 money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to 
 be UNK-277 for our UNK-247 cup of tea itself as a great UNK-805 to be 
 noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on i

 them that UNK-693 singing her UNK-324 she UNK-3 make much secret of 
 what she UNK-180 yes and the second pair of UNK-692 stockings is UNK-616 
 after one days wear i could have brought them back to UNK-505 this 
 morning and UNK-986 up a row and made that one change them only not to 
 upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and UNK-507 the whole 
 thing and one of those UNK-587 UNK-474 id want UNK-617 cheap in 
 the UNK-672 with UNK-582 UNK-532 on the UNK-40 he saved the one i have

 magnificent head of hair on her down to her UNK-599 UNK-680 it back like 
 that like kitty UNK-348 in UNK-924 street UNK-243 thing i did every morning 
 to look across see her UNK-865 it as if she loved it and was full of it 
 UNK-47 i only got to know her the day before we left and that mrs UNK-567 
 the jersey UNK-246 the prince of wales was in love with i suppose UNK-2 like 
 the first man going the roads only for the name of a king UNK-30 all 
 made the one way only a black UNK-54 id like to try a beauty up to what 
 was she UNK-134 there was some funny story about the UNK-528 old husband what 
 was it at all and an UNK-702 knife he went no he made her wear a kind 
 of a tin thing round her and the prince of wales yes he had the UNK-702 
 knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings 
 me the works of master UNK-8 somebody supposed to be a priest about 
 a child born out of her ear because her UNK-943 fell out a nice word for 
 any priest to write and her ae as if any fool UNK-9 know what that 
 meant i hate that UNK-438 of all things with that old UNK-636 
 face on him anybody can see its not true and that ruby and fair UNK-505 
 he brought me that twice i remember when i came to page UNK-137 o the part 
 about where she UNK-190 him up out of a hook with a cord UNK-603 
 sure UNK-6 nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he 
 drinking the champagne out of her UNK-7 after the ball was over like 
 the infant jesus in the UNK-178 at UNK-335 in the blessed UNK-420 arms 
 sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and i thought 
 first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber 
 when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt UNK-1 h r h 
 he was in gibraltar the year i was born i bet he found UNK-822 there too 
 where he UNK-887 the tree he UNK-887 more than that in his time he might 
 have UNK-887 me too if UNK-25 come a bit UNK-973 then i UNK-9 be here as 
 i am he ought to chuck that UNK-308 with the UNK-487 few UNK-51 
 he UNK-246 out of it and go into an office or something where UNK-25 get 
 regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a UNK-980 to count 
 the money all the day of course he prefers UNK-776 about the house 
 so you cant UNK-94 with him any side whats your programme today i wish UNK-25 
 even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or UNK-438 
 to be UNK-607 about for advertisements when he could have been in mr 
 UNK-160 still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up 
 i could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great 
 UNK-73 once or twice first he was as UNK-257 as the UNK-974 really and 
 truly mrs bloom only i felt UNK-833 simply with the old UNK-118 dress 
 that i lost the leads out of the UNK-911 with no cut in it but UNK-30 
 coming into fashion again i bought it simply to please him i knew it was 
 no good by the finish UNK-47 i changed my mind of going to todd and UNK-900 
 as i said and not UNK-804 it was just like the shop itself UNK-358 sale a 
 lot of trash i hate those rich shops get on your UNK-510 nothing kills me 
 UNK-537 only he thinks he knows a great lot about a UNK-95 dress and 
 cooking UNK-544 everything he can UNK-788 off the UNK-891 into it if 
 i went by his UNK-262 every blessed hat i put on does that suit me yes 
 take that thats UNK-137 the one like a UNK-308 standing up miles 
 off my head he said suited me or the UNK-405 one coming down on my 
 UNK-830 on pins and UNK-486 about the UNK-352 in that place in UNK-804 
 street i had the UNK-974 to bring him into and she as UNK-312 as 
 ever she could be with her UNK-125 saying im afraid were giving you too 
 much trouble what UNK-23 there for but i UNK-156 it out of her yes he was 
 UNK-229 UNK-257 and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked 
 UNK-262 UNK-550 as usual like the soup but i could see him looking very 
 hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of 
 him to show me out in any case im extremely sorry mrs bloom believe me 
 without making it too marked the first time after him being UNK-153 and 
 me being supposed to be his wife i just half UNK-24 i know my chest was 
 out that way at the door when he said im extremely sorry and im sure you 
 were 
 UNK-0 
 yes i think he made them a bit UNK-58 sucking them like that so long he 
 made me UNK-403 UNK-362 he calls them i had to laugh yes this one UNK-58 
 UNK-257 the nipple gets for the least thing ill get him to keep that up 
 and ill take those eggs UNK-309 up with UNK-318 UNK-754 them out for him 
 what are all those UNK-692 and things curious the way its made UNK-67 the same 
 in case of twins UNK-30 supposed to represent beauty placed up there 
 like those UNK-848 in the museum one of them UNK-438 to hide it with 
 her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks 
 like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of 
 him or UNK-925 up at you like a UNK-291 no wonder they hide it with a 
 UNK-279 that UNK-528 cameron UNK-90 behind the meat market or 
 that other UNK-208 with the red head behind the tree where the UNK-287 
 of the fish used to be when i was passing UNK-438 he was pissing 
 standing out for me to see it with his UNK-57 up to one side the 
 queens own they were a nice lot its well the UNK-943 UNK-361 them 
 UNK-30 always trying to show it to you every time nearly i passed 
 outside the mens greenhouse near the UNK-164 street station just to 
 try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was i of the 
 UNK-329 UNK-94 of the world o and the UNK-3 of those UNK-833 places the night 
 coming home with UNK-262 after the UNK-929 party UNK-725 and UNK-543 
 to make you feel nice and UNK-138 i went into r of them it was so UNK-154 
 cold i UNK-18 keep it when was that UNK-146 the canal was frozen yes it was 
 a few months after a UNK-47 a couple of the UNK-769 UNK-265 there to see 
 me UNK-333 in the mens place UNK-648 i tried to draw a picture of 
 it before i UNK-814 it up like a UNK-324 or something i wonder UNK-30 not 
 afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the 
 woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said i could pose for a 
 picture naked to some rich fellow in UNK-305 street when he lost the 
 job in UNK-923 and i was selling the clothes and UNK-955 in the coffee 
 palace would i be like that bath of the UNK-354 with my hair down yes only 
 UNK-23 younger or im a little like that dirty bitch in that spanish photo 
 he has UNK-894 used they go about like that i asked him about her and 
 that word met something with UNK-167 in it and he came out with some 
 UNK-24 about the UNK-391 he never can explain a thing simply 
 the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of 
 the pan all for his kidney this one not so much UNK-6 the mark of his 
 teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple i had to UNK-509 out UNK-602 
 they UNK-883 trying to hurt you i had a great breast of milk with UNK-127 
 enough for two what was the reason of that he said i could have got a 
 pound a week as a wet nurse all UNK-641 out the morning that UNK-325 
 looking student that stopped in no UNK-769 with the UNK-214 UNK-856 nearly 
 caught me washing through the window only for i UNK-310 up the UNK-186 to 
 my face that was his UNK-19 hurt me they used to UNK-734 her till he 
 got doctor UNK-449 to give me the UNK-738 prescription i had to get him 
 to suck them they were so hard he said it was UNK-682 and UNK-331 than 
 UNK-633 then he wanted to milk me into the tea well UNK-2 beyond everything i 
 declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if i only could remember 
 the i half of the things and write a book out of it the works of master 
 UNK-262 yes and its so much UNK-26 the skin much an hour he was at them

 woman i can feel his mouth o lord i must stretch myself i UNK-136 he was 
 here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that i feel 
 all fire inside me or if i could dream it when he made me spend the UNK-708

 UNK-573 with equal UNK-171 the greatest UNK-392 happiness answer to a 
 UNK-885 proposal UNK-163 my UNK-403 UNK-6 nothing else its 
 all very fine for them but as for being a woman as soon as UNK-14 old 
 they might as well throw you out in the bottom of the UNK-277 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-885 was the first when i was in bed that morning and mrs UNK-83 
 brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when i asked her 
 to hand me and i pointing at them i UNK-18 think of the word a UNK-322 
 to open it with ah UNK-922 UNK-273 old thing and it UNK-151 her 
 in the face with her switch of false hair on her and UNK-398 about her 
 appearance ugly as she was near UNK-17 or a UNK-368 her face a mass of UNK-378 
 with all her religion UNK-760 because she never could get over the 
 atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the union jack 
 flying with all her UNK-508 because UNK-281 UNK-355 english UNK-2 took 
 all the rock from them and because i UNK-3 run into mass often enough in 
 santa maria to please her with her UNK-975 up on her except when there was 
 a marriage on with all her UNK-337 of the saints and her black blessed 
 virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing UNK-225 times on easter 
 sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing 
 the vatican to the dying UNK-697 herself for his UNK-420 an UNK-56 
 he signed it i near UNK-615 out of my skin i wanted to pick him up when 
 i saw him following me along the UNK-502 real in the shop window then 
 he UNK-303 me just in passing but i never thought UNK-25 write making an 
 appointment i had it inside my UNK-470 UNK-625 all day reading it up 
 in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill UNK-639 to 
 find out by the UNK-745 or the language of stamps singing i remember 
 shall i wear a white rose and i wanted to put on the old stupid clock to 
 near the time he was the first man UNK-166 me under the UNK-769 wall my 
 UNK-495 when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till 
 he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was UNK-243 young i put my 
 knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did i tell him i was 
 engaged for for fun to the son of a spanish UNK-135 named don UNK-756 de 
 la UNK-397 and he believed me that i was to be married to him in UNK-225 years 
 time UNK-6 many a true word spoken in UNK-545 there is a flower that 
 UNK-9 a few things i told him true about myself just for him to be 
 UNK-316 the spanish girls he UNK-3 like i suppose one of them UNK-9 
 have him i got him excited he UNK-880 all the flowers on my UNK-186 he 
 brought me he UNK-18 count the UNK-615 and the UNK-980 till i 
 taught him UNK-117 he came from he said on the black water but it was 
 too short then the day before he left may yes it was may when the infant 
 king of spain was born im always like that in the spring id like a new 
 fellow every year up on the UNK-648 under the UNK-985 near UNK-121 tower 
 i told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old UNK-342 UNK-632 
 they sent to UNK-482 without a tail UNK-36 all over the show on each 
 others back mrs UNK-83 said she was a regular old rock UNK-328 UNK-690 
 the UNK-37 out of UNK-57 farm and throw stones at you if you went UNK-248 
 he was looking at me i had that white UNK-413 on open in the front to 
 encourage him as much as i could without too UNK-182 they were just 
 beginning to be UNK-191 i said i was tired we lay over the UNK-460 cove 
 a wild place i suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the 
 galleries and UNK-507 and those UNK-728 rocks and saint UNK-154 
 cave with the UNK-433 or whatever they call them hanging down and 
 UNK-841 all the mud UNK-873 my boots im sure thats the way down the 
 UNK-626 go under the sea to africa when they die the ships out far like 
 chips that was the malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could 
 do what you liked lie there for ever he UNK-349 them outside they love 
 doing that its the UNK-186 there i was UNK-200 over him with my white 
 UNK-765 hat to take the UNK-464 out of it the left side of my face the 
 best my UNK-413 open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had i 
 could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment 
 but i UNK-9 lee him he was UNK-229 put out first for fear you never 
 know consumption or leave me with a child UNK-531 that old UNK-363 
 UNK-481 told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after i tried 
 with the banana but i was afraid it might break and get lost up in me 
 somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was 
 up there for years covered with UNK-681 UNK-30 all mad to get in there 
 where they come out of UNK-306 think they could never go far enough up and 
 then UNK-30 done with you in a way till the next time yes because UNK-6 
 a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it 
 off yes o yes i pulled him off into my UNK-185 UNK-438 not to 
 be excited but i opened my legs i UNK-9 let him touch me inside my 
 UNK-470 because i had a skirt opening up the side i UNK-77 the 
 life out of him first UNK-96 him i loved UNK-885 that dog in the hotel 
 UNK-495 UNK-791 his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was 
 UNK-523 all the same i liked him like that UNK-86 i made him UNK-801 a little 
 when i got over him that way when i UNK-132 him and took his out and 
 drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it UNK-30 all buttons men 
 down the middle on the wrong side of them UNK-36 UNK-285 he called me 
 what was his name jack joe harry UNK-845 was it yes i think a UNK-731 
 he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so i went round to 
 the UNK-118 everything was UNK-118 UNK-91 had he he said 
 UNK-25 come back lord its just like yesterday to me and if i was married 
 UNK-25 do it to me and i promised him yes UNK-396 id let him block me 
 now flying perhaps UNK-2 dead or killed or a captain or UNK-570 its nearly 
 UNK-500 years if i said UNK-460 cove he would if he came up behind me and 
 put his hands over my eyes to guess who i might UNK-156 him UNK-2 young 
 still about UNK-628 perhaps UNK-2 married some girl on the black water and is 
 quite changed they all do they UNK-204 half the character a woman has she 
 little knows what i did with her UNK-506 husband before he ever UNK-459 
 of her in broad UNK-917 too in the sight of the whole world you might 
 say they could have put an article about it in the chronicle i was a bit 
 wild after when i UNK-299 out the old bag the UNK-140 were in from UNK-615 
 UNK-851 and UNK-492 it lord what a bang all the UNK-886 and UNK-870 
 UNK-121 coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round 
 by the old UNK-914 and the jews UNK-705 UNK-438 to read out 
 the hebrew on them i wanted to fire his UNK-594 he said he UNK-180 one he 
 UNK-3 know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always UNK-71 
 UNK-529 as often as i settled it straight h m s UNK-457 UNK-907 my hat 
 that old bishop that spoke off the UNK-92 his long UNK-867 about UNK-95 
 higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak 
 caps and the new woman UNK-640 god send him sense and me more money i 
 suppose UNK-30 called after him i never thought that would be my 
 name bloom when i used to write it in print to see how it looked on a 
 visiting card or UNK-617 for the UNK-203 and UNK-373 m bloom UNK-14 
 looking UNK-403 UNK-414 used to say after i married him well its better 
 than UNK-115 or UNK-529 does UNK-691 or those awful names with bottom in them 
 mrs UNK-160 or some other kind of a bottom UNK-845 i UNK-9 go mad 
 about either or suppose i UNK-343 him mrs UNK-43 my mother UNK-862 she 
 was might have given me a UNK-382 name the lord knows after the lovely 
 one she had UNK-485 UNK-312 the fun we had running along UNK-777 road to 
 UNK-904 point UNK-990 in and out all round the other side of jersey they 
 were UNK-144 and dancing about in my UNK-413 like UNK-212 little ones now 
 when she runs up the UNK-93 i loved looking down at them i was jumping 
 up at the pepper trees and the white UNK-633 pulling the leaves off and 
 throwing them at him he went to india he was to write the UNK-524 those 
 men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they 
 might get a UNK-139 or two at a woman while they can going out to be 
 UNK-69 or UNK-944 up somewhere i went up UNK-392 hill to the UNK-782 
 that sunday morning with captain UNK-514 that was dead UNK-880 like the 
 UNK-915 had he said UNK-25 have one or two from on board i UNK-71 that UNK-117 
 from the b UNK-792 paris and the coral necklace the UNK-455 UNK-160 i 
 could see over to morocco almost the bay of UNK-344 white and the atlas 
 mountain with snow on it and the UNK-455 like a river so clear harry 
 UNK-36 UNK-285 i was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at 
 mass when my UNK-470 began to slip down at the elevation weeks and 
 weeks i kept the UNK-185 under my pillow for the smell of him there 
 was no decent perfume to be got in that gibraltar only that cheap UNK-413 
 UNK-204 that UNK-238 and left a UNK-3 on you more than anything else i 
 wanted to give him a UNK-745 he gave me that UNK-713 UNK-28 ring for 
 luck that i gave UNK-701 going to south africa where those UNK-187 killed 
 him with their war and fever but they were well UNK-309 all the same as 
 if it brought its bad luck with it like an UNK-503 or pearl still it must 
 have been pure UNK-681 UNK-903 gold because it was very heavy but what could 
 you get in a place like that the UNK-235 shower from africa and that 
 UNK-881 ship that came up to the harbour marie the marie UNK-118

 all UNK-21 with the UNK-368 and the hat i had with that UNK-227 all 
 UNK-156 and UNK-481 on me how annoying and UNK-481 because the smell of 
 the sea excited me of course the UNK-432 and the UNK-739 in UNK-473 bay 
 round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the UNK-544 
 baskets old UNK-355 near a hundred they said came from UNK-799 and the tall 
 old UNK-26 with the earrings i dont like a man you have to climb up to to 
 get at i suppose UNK-30 all dead and UNK-833 long ago besides i dont like 
 being alone in this big UNK-436 of a place at night i suppose ill have 
 to put up with it i never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved 
 in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor 
 UNK-411 with a UNK-459 or UNK-34 private hotel he suggested go 
 and UNK-625 himself UNK-537 the way his father did down in UNK-844 like 
 all the things he told father he was going to do and me but i saw 
 through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the 
 UNK-250 venice by UNK-330 with the UNK-281 and the lake of UNK-773 he 
 had a picture cut out of some paper of and UNK-246 and UNK-318 o 
 how nice i said whatever i liked he was going to do immediately if 
 not UNK-973 will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a 
 leather medal with a UNK-955 rim for all the plans he UNK-937 then leaving 
 us here all day UNK-306 never know what old UNK-806 at the door for a UNK-584 
 with his long story might be a UNK-302 and put his foot in the way to 
 prevent me UNK-146 it like that picture of that UNK-333 criminal he 
 was called in UNK-603 weekly news UNK-500 years in jail then he comes out and 
 UNK-693 an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or 
 UNK-862 she is such a face UNK-306 run miles away from i UNK-18 rest easy 
 till i UNK-418 all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again 
 being locked up like in a prison or a UNK-431 they ought to be all shot 
 or the cat of nine UNK-911 a big UNK-64 like that that would attack a poor 
 old woman to murder her in her bed id cut them off him so i would not 
 that UNK-25 be much use still better than nothing the night i was sure 
 i heard UNK-12 in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a 
 candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet 
 UNK-979 out of his UNK-115 making as much noise as he possibly could 
 for the UNK-12 benefit there UNK-50 much to steal indeed the lord knows 
 still its the feeling especially now with UNK-127 away such an idea for 
 him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account 
 of his UNK-423 instead of sending her to UNK-957 academy where shed 
 have to learn not like me getting all is at school only UNK-25 do a thing 
 like that all the same on account of me and UNK-43 thats why he did 
 it im certain the way he plots and plans everything out i UNK-18 turn 
 round with her in the place lately unless i UNK-418 the door first gave 
 me the UNK-2 coming in without UNK-800 first when i put the chair 
 against the door just as i was washing myself there below with the UNK-516

 to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she 
 UNK-438 to understand UNK-147 of course that comes from his side of the 
 house he cant say i UNK-883 things can he im too honest as a matter of 
 fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with

 deep yet i never came properly till i was what UNK-760 or so it went into the 
 wrong place always only the usual girls UNK-221 and UNK-656 that 
 UNK-840 UNK-196 writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with 
 UNK-928 though she UNK-27 when the UNK-622 came down because he 
 looked so UNK-218 then we had martin harvey for breakfast dinner and 
 UNK-255 i thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man 
 gives up his life for her that way for nothing i suppose there are a 
 few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really 
 happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their 
 UNK-978 to find two people like that UNK-475 full up of each other that 
 would feel the same way as you do UNK-30 usually a bit UNK-735 in the 
 head his father must have been a bit UNK-81 to go and poison himself 
 after her still poor old man i suppose he felt lost UNK-23 always making 
 love to my things too the few old UNK-244 i have wanting to put her hair up 
 at i s my powder too only UNK-625 her skin on her UNK-23 time enough for that 
 all her life after of course UNK-23 UNK-741 knowing UNK-23 pretty with her 
 lips so red a UNK-47 they UNK-19 stay that way i was too but UNK-6 no use 
 going to the fair with the thing answering me like a UNK-905 when 
 i asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met mrs joe 
 UNK-53 at the UNK-25 and she UNK-204 not to see us in her 
 trap with UNK-674 the UNK-698 we UNK-265 grand enough till i gave her UNK-67 
 damn fine UNK-970 across the ear for herself take that now for answering 
 me like that and that for your UNK-387 she had me that UNK-737 of 
 course UNK-588 i was UNK-200 too because how was it there was 
 a weed in the tea or i UNK-3 sleep the night before cheese i ate was it 
 and i told her over and over again not to leave knives UNK-112 like that 
 because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he 
 UNK-55 correct her faith i will that was the last time she turned on the 
 UNK-638 i was just like that myself they UNK-798 order me about the place 
 its his fault of course having the two of us UNK-193 here instead of 
 getting in a woman long ago am i ever going to have a proper UNK-363 
 again of course then shed see him coming id have to let her know or shed 
 revenge it UNK-602 they a UNK-0 that old mrs UNK-132 you have to be 
 walking round after her putting the things into her hands UNK-925 and 
 UNK-859 into the UNK-313 well of course UNK-23 old she cant help it a good 
 job i found that UNK-833 old UNK-523 UNK-646 that got lost behind the 
 UNK-438 i knew there was something and opened the area window to let out

 his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his 
 UNK-376 one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those 
 prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing

 UNK-50 when i took off only my UNK-413 and skirt first in the other 
 room he was so busy where he UNK-169 to be he never felt me i hope my 
 breath was sweet after those kissing UNK-121 easy god i remember one 
 time i could scout it out straight UNK-604 like a man almost easy o 
 lord how UNK-132 i hope UNK-30 UNK-991 on it for a UNK-499 of money from some 
 fellow UNK-12 have to perfume it in the morning dont forget i bet he

 who knows is there anything the matter with my UNK-976 or have i 
 something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was 
 it last i UNK-541 monday yes its only about UNK-225 weeks i ought to go to the 
 doctor only it would be like before i married him when i had that white 
 thing coming from me and UNK-490 made me go to that dry old stick dr 
 collins for womens diseases on UNK-81 road your vagina he called it i 
 suppose thats how he got all the UNK-294 mirrors and UNK-988 getting round 
 those rich ones off UNK-8 green running up to him for every little 
 UNK-899 her vagina and her UNK-29 UNK-67 money of course so 
 UNK-30 all right i UNK-9 UNK-454 him not if he was the last man in 
 the world besides UNK-6 something UNK-81 about their children always 
 UNK-749 around those UNK-947 UNK-898 all sides asking me if what i did 
 had an offensive UNK-143 what did he want me to do but the one thing gold 
 maybe what a question if i UNK-324 it all over his UNK-835 old face 
 for him with all my UNK-601 i suppose UNK-25 know then and could you 
 pass it easily pass what i thought he was talking about the rock of 
 gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the 
 way only i like letting myself down after in the hole as far as i can 
 UNK-139 and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and UNK-486 
 still UNK-6 something in it i suppose i always used to know by UNK-212 
 when she was a child whether she had UNK-768 or not still all the same 
 paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking 
 me had i frequent omissions where do those old UNK-13 get all the words 
 they have omissions with his UNK-1 eyes on me UNK-786 UNK-174 i 
 UNK-9 trust him too far to give me UNK-674 or god knows what else 
 still i liked him when he sat down to write the thing out UNK-449 so 
 severe his nose intelligent like that you be UNK-100 you lying strap o 
 anything no matter who except an UNK-818 he was UNK-324 enough to spot 
 that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters 
 my precious one everything connected with your UNK-520 body everything 
 UNK-582 that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever 
 something he got out of some UNK-132 book that he had me always at 
 myself UNK-281 and UNK-137 times a day sometimes and i said i UNK-180 are you sure 
 o yes i said i am quite sure in a way that shut him up i knew what was 
 coming next only natural UNK-688 it was he excited me i dont know how 
 the first night ever we met when i was living in UNK-213 terrace we 
 stood UNK-151 at one another for about lo minutes as if we met somewhere 
 i suppose on account of my being UNK-973 looking after my mother he used 
 to UNK-317 me the things he said with the half UNK-512 smile on him 
 and all the UNK-95 said he was going to stand for a member of parliament 
 o UNK-69 i the born fool to believe all his UNK-243 about home rule 
 and the land league sending me that long UNK-569 of a song out of the 
 UNK-823 to sing in french to be more UNK-434 o UNK-353 pays de la UNK-204 
 that i never even UNK-57 once explaining and UNK-221 about religion 
 and UNK-118 he UNK-19 let you enjoy anything naturally then might he 
 as a great favour the very UNK-243 opportunity he got a chance in brighton 
 square running into my bedroom UNK-438 the ink got on his hands to 
 wash it off with the UNK-572 milk and UNK-84 soap i used to use and the 
 UNK-590 still round it o i UNK-20 myself sick at him that day i better 
 not make an UNK-178 sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a 
 natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he UNK-152 down to 
 do it i suppose there UNK-50 in all creation another man with the habits 
 he has look at the way UNK-2 sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he 
 without a hard UNK-873 its well he UNK-55 kick or he might knock out 
 all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that indian god 
 he took me to show one wet sunday in the museum in UNK-328 street all 
 yellow in a UNK-193 lying on his side on his hand with his ten UNK-297 
 UNK-925 out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and 
 our UNK-153 both put together all over asia UNK-311 him as UNK-2 always 
 UNK-311 everybody i suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed 
 too with his big square feet up in his UNK-522 mouth damn this UNK-372 
 thing anyway UNK-189 this those UNK-564 are ah yes i know i hope the old 
 press UNK-55 UNK-995 ah i knew it would UNK-2 sleeping hard had a good time 
 somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of 
 course he has to pay for it from her o this UNK-0 of a thing i hope 
 UNK-450 have something better for us in the other world UNK-958 ourselves 
 up god help us thats all right for tonight now the UNK-799 old UNK-171 
 bed always UNK-137 me of old cohen i suppose he UNK-274 himself in it 
 often enough and he thinks father bought it from lord UNK-756 that i used

 men with our UNK-281 sticks of furniture and then the city arms hotel worse 
 and worse says UNK-659 UNK-954 that charming place on the landing always 
 somebody inside UNK-725 then leaving all their UNK-346 after them

 something happens or he puts his big foot in it UNK-168 and UNK-923 and mr

 UNK-308 too like the rest on account of those UNK-473 UNK-557 or the 
 UNK-726 then well see if the little man he showed me UNK-16

 UNK-406 that he says is so capable and UNK-807 irish he is indeed 
 UNK-887 by the UNK-904 of the UNK-48 i saw on him wait UNK-6

 UNK-549 all over his big UNK-961 face like a UNK-330 UNK-337 UNK-304 
 UNK-3 he look a UNK-946 UNK-983 sure enough that must have been a 
 UNK-876 on the stage imagine paying UNK-137 in the UNK-267 seats for 
 that to see him UNK-287 off in his UNK-818 and simon UNK-1 too he 
 was always turning up half UNK-960 singing the second verse first the 
 old love is the new was one of his so UNK-951 UNK-57 the maiden on the 
 UNK-540 UNK-403 he was always on for UNK-561 too when i UNK-57 UNK-267 
 with him at UNK-134 UNK-836 private opera he had a delicious UNK-520 
 voice UNK-969 UNK-983 UNK-244 UNK-495 sweetheart he always UNK-57 it 
 not like UNK-334 UNK-184 sweet UNK-114 UNK-244 of course he had the gift of 
 the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm UNK-544 
 o UNK-267 UNK-708 flower we UNK-57 UNK-178 though it was a bit too 
 high for my register even UNK-700 and he was married at the time to 
 may UNK-172 but then UNK-25 say or do something to knock the good out of 
 it UNK-2 a UNK-283 now i wonder what sort is his son he says UNK-2 an author 
 and going to be a university professor of italian and im to take lessons 
 what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me i 
 ought to have got it taken in UNK-686 that never looks out of fashion 
 still i look young in it i wonder he UNK-3 make him a present of it 
 UNK-537 and me too after all why not i saw him driving down to the 
 UNK-58 station with his father and mother i was in UNK-210 thats 
 UNK-35 years ago now yes UNK-25 be UNK-35 though what was the good in going into 
 UNK-210 for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was 
 enough for me i heard the UNK-543 too UNK-356 in the wall of course 
 he UNK-100 UNK-25 go into UNK-210 for the cat i suppose UNK-2 a man now by 
 this time he was an innocent boy then and a UNK-285 little fellow in his 
 lord UNK-398 suit and UNK-693 hair like a prince on the stage when i 
 saw him at mat UNK-661 he liked me too i remember they all do wait by 
 god yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when i laid 
 out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met 
 before i thought it meant him but UNK-2 no chicken nor a stranger either 
 besides my face was turned the other way what was the UNK-437 card after 
 that the UNK-503 of UNK-285 for a journey by land then there was a letter on 
 its way and UNK-567 too the UNK-225 queens and the UNK-701 of diamonds for a rise 
 in society yes wait it all came out and UNK-67 red UNK-334 for new UNK-829 look 
 at that and UNK-3 i dream something too yes there was something about 
 poetry in it i hope he UNK-696 long UNK-830 hair hanging into his eyes or 
 standing up like a red indian what do they go about like that for only 
 getting themselves and their poetry UNK-20 at i always liked poetry 
 when i was a girl first i thought he was a poet like lord UNK-172 and not 
 an UNK-169 of it in his composition i thought he was quite different i 
 wonder is he too young UNK-2 about wait UNK-705 i was married UNK-705 UNK-127 is UNK-704 
 yesterday UNK-743 what age was he then at UNK-661 UNK-137 or UNK-592 about UNK-705 i suppose 
 UNK-2 UNK-500 or more im not too old for him if UNK-2 UNK-193 or UNK-198 i hope UNK-2 not 
 that UNK-871 university student sort no otherwise he UNK-9 go sitting 
 down in the old kitchen with him taking UNK-138 UNK-323 and talking of 
 course he UNK-204 to understand it all probably he told him he was 
 out of trinity college UNK-2 very young to be a professor i hope UNK-2 not 
 a professor like UNK-156 was he was a UNK-866 professor of john UNK-926 
 they all write about some woman in their poetry well i suppose he UNK-19 
 find many like me where UNK-41 UNK-281 of love the light guitar where 
 poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon UNK-160 so beautifully 
 coming back on the UNK-601 from UNK-240 the UNK-579 at UNK-904 point 
 the guitar that fellow played was so UNK-552 will i ever go back 
 there again all new faces two UNK-220 eyes a UNK-473 UNK-373 ill sing that 
 for him UNK-30 my eyes if UNK-2 anything of a poet two eyes as UNK-326 
 bright as loves own star UNK-602 those beautiful words as loves young star 
 UNK-404 be a change the lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk 
 to about yourself not always listening to him and billy UNK-520 ad 
 and UNK-556 ad and tom the UNK-268 ad then if anything goes wrong in their 
 business we have to suffer im sure UNK-2 very distinguished id like to 
 meet a man like that god not those other UNK-548 besides UNK-2 young those 
 fine young men i could see down in UNK-335 strand UNK-648 from the 
 side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a god or something 
 and then UNK-655 into the sea with them why UNK-602 all men like that 
 UNK-581 be some UNK-406 for a woman like that lovely little UNK-287 he 
 bought i could look at him all day long UNK-693 head and his UNK-61 
 his finger up for you to listen UNK-6 real beauty and poetry for you 
 i often felt i wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock 
 there so simple i UNK-9 mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was 
 looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks 
 with his UNK-848 face i would too in UNK-502 a minute even if some of it went 
 down what its only like UNK-663 or the UNK-826 UNK-6 no danger besides UNK-25 
 be so clean compared with those UNK-380 of men i suppose never dream of 
 washing it from i years end to the other the most of them only thats 
 what gives the women the UNK-429 im sure UNK-404 be grand if i can only 
 get in with a UNK-218 young poet at my age ill throw them the UNK-243 thing

 nothing in his nature UNK-277 us behind like that on my bottom because 
 i UNK-3 call him hugh the UNK-555 that UNK-55 know poetry from a 
 UNK-388 thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place 
 pulling off his shoes and UNK-48 there on the chair before me so 
 UNK-389 without even asking permission and standing out that UNK-314 
 way in the half of a shirt they wear to be UNK-336 like a priest or a 
 UNK-203 or those old UNK-561 in the time of UNK-734 UNK-856 of course 
 UNK-2 right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might 
 as well be in bed with what with a lion god im sure UNK-25 have something 
 better to say for himself an old lion would o well i suppose its because 
 they were so UNK-191 and UNK-282 in my short UNK-470 he UNK-18 resist 
 they UNK-333 myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure 
 they get off a UNK-95 body were so round and white for them always i 
 UNK-136 i was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they 
 have UNK-446 up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you 
 touch it my uncle john has a thing long i heard those UNK-869 saying 
 passing the UNK-911 of UNK-943 lane my UNK-7 mary has a thing hairy 
 because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it UNK-3 make me 
 UNK-801 why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long 
 into my UNK-7 UNK-928 hairy UNK-255 and turns out to be you put the handle 
 in a UNK-793 men again all over they can pick and choose what they 
 please a married woman or a fast UNK-265 or a girl for their different 
 UNK-560 like those houses round behind irish street no but were to be

 once i start i tell you for their stupid UNK-624 UNK-315 why cant we 
 all remain friends over it instead of UNK-67 her husband found it 
 out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it 
 UNK-2 UNK-61 anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other 
 mad extreme about the wife in fair UNK-505 of course the man never even 
 UNK-57 a UNK-708 thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants 
 and he gets her what else were we given all those UNK-46 for id like to 
 know i cant help it if im young still can i its a wonder im not an old 
 UNK-421 UNK-996 before my time living with him so cold never UNK-430 
 me except sometimes when UNK-2 UNK-314 the wrong end of me not knowing i 
 suppose who he has any man UNK-112 kiss a UNK-95 bottom id throw my hat at 
 him after that UNK-25 kiss anything UNK-58 where we UNK-204 i atom of any 
 kind of expression in us all of us the same UNK-67 UNK-882 of UNK-171 before ever 
 id do that to a man UNK-35 the dirty UNK-948 the mere thought is enough 
 i kiss the feet of you UNK-800 UNK-6 some sense in that UNK-3 he kiss 
 our UNK-581 yes he did what a UNK-481 nobody UNK-240 his UNK-871 
 ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be UNK-448 UNK-500 times a day 
 almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love 
 or loved by somebody if the fellow you want UNK-50 there sometimes by the 
 lord god i was thinking would i go around by the UNK-719 there some dark 
 evening where UNK-289 know me and pick up a UNK-99 off the sea UNK-112 be 
 hot on for it and not care a pin whose i was only do it off up in a gate 
 somewhere or one of those UNK-33 UNK-926 in UNK-50 had their 
 camp UNK-199 near the UNK-221 laundry to try and steal our things if 
 they could i only sent mine there a few times for the name model 
 laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that 
 UNK-583 fellow with the fine eyes UNK-516 a switch attack me 
 in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a UNK-1 
 anybody what they do themselves the fine UNK-32 in their silk hats 
 that k c lives up somewhere this way coming out of UNK-797 lane the 
 night he gave us the fish UNK-255 on account of winning over the boxing 
 match of course it was for me he gave it i knew him by his UNK-509 and 
 the walk and when i turned round a minute after just to see there was 
 a woman after coming out of it too some UNK-947 UNK-937 then he goes 
 home to his wife after that only i suppose the half of those UNK-2 are 
 UNK-833 again with disease o move over your big UNK-211 out of that for 
 the love of mike listen to him the winds that UNK-960 my UNK-281 to thee so 
 well he may sleep and UNK-317 the great UNK-157 don UNK-4 de la UNK-397 if 
 he knew how he came out on the cards this morning UNK-25 have something to 
 UNK-317 for a dark man in some UNK-812 between UNK-67 UNK-556 too in prison for 
 lord knows what he does that i dont know and im to be UNK-212 around 
 down in the kitchen to get his UNK-425 his breakfast while UNK-2 rolled 
 up like a UNK-893 will i indeed did you ever see me running id just like 
 to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt 
 i dont care what anybody says UNK-509 be much better for the world to be 
 UNK-397 by the women in it you UNK-9 see women going and killing one 
 another and UNK-818 when do you ever see women rolling around drunk 
 like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses 
 yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they 
 UNK-9 be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to 
 be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be 
 if they UNK-180 all a mother to look after them what i never had thats 
 why i suppose UNK-2 running wild now out at night away from his books 
 and studies and not living at home on account of the usual UNK-531 house i 
 suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that 
 UNK-30 not satisfied and i none was he not able to make one it UNK-69 my 
 fault we came together when i was watching the two dogs up in her behind 
 in the middle of the naked street that UNK-843 me UNK-537 i 
 suppose i UNK-169 to have buried him in that little UNK-471 jacket i 
 UNK-756 UNK-273 as i was but give it to some poor child but i knew well 
 id never have another our UNK-243 death too it was we were never the same 
 since o im not going to think myself into the UNK-751 about that any 
 more i wonder why he UNK-9 stay the night i felt all the time it was 
 somebody strange he brought in instead of UNK-18 around the city meeting 
 god knows who UNK-465 and UNK-791 his poor mother UNK-9 
 like that if she was alive UNK-507 himself for life perhaps still its a 
 lovely hour so silent i used to love coming home after UNK-184 the air of 
 the night they have friends they can talk to UNK-623 none either he wants 
 what he UNK-19 get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you i 
 hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a 
 UNK-348 lot of UNK-898 i suppose its all the UNK-117 we have makes us 
 so UNK-585 im not like that he could easy have UNK-613 in there on the sofa 
 in the other room i suppose he was as UNK-523 as a boy he being so young 
 hardly UNK-500 of me in the next room UNK-25 have heard me on the chamber UNK-723 
 what harm UNK-1 i wonder its like those names in gibraltar UNK-954 
 UNK-515 they had the UNK-268 UNK-81 names there father UNK-93 of 
 santa maria that gave me the UNK-536 UNK-713 y UNK-884 in the UNK-502 las 
 UNK-869 UNK-253 and UNK-954 and mrs UNK-639 in governor street o what a 
 name id go and UNK-31 myself in the first river if i had a name like 
 her o my and all the bits of streets paradise UNK-476 and UNK-693 UNK-476 and 
 UNK-586 UNK-476 and UNK-552 UNK-476 and the UNK-268 gap steps well small 
 blame to me if i am a UNK-946 i know i am a bit i declare to god i 
 dont feel a day older than then i wonder could i get my tongue round 
 any of the spanish UNK-773 UNK-669 UNK-2 UNK-128 UNK-396 UNK-26 y UNK-2 see i UNK-204 
 forgotten it all i thought i had only for the grammar a UNK-498 is the 
 name of any person place or thing UNK-47 i never tried to read that novel 
 UNK-634 mrs UNK-83 UNK-256 me by UNK-855 with the questions in it all 
 UNK-291 down the two ways i always knew wed go away in the end i can 
 tell him the spanish and he tell me the italian then hell see im not 
 so UNK-814 what a UNK-47 he UNK-3 stay im sure the poor fellow was dead 
 tired and wanted a good sleep badly i could have brought him in his 
 breakfast in bed with a bit of UNK-550 so long as i UNK-3 do it on 
 the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the 
 UNK-113 and something nice and UNK-109 there are a few UNK-395 in the 
 kitchen he might like i never could bear the look of them in UNK-212 
 i could do the UNK-858 the room looks all right since i changed it the 
 other way you see something was telling me all the time id have to 
 introduce myself not knowing me from adam very funny UNK-9 it im his 
 wife or UNK-883 we were in spain with him half UNK-340 without a gods 
 notion where he is dos UNK-857 UNK-542 UNK-107 lord the UNK-871 things 
 come into my head sometimes UNK-509 be great fun UNK-885 he stayed with us 
 why not UNK-6 the room UNK-316 empty and UNK-212 bed in the back room 
 he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the 
 UNK-53 he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning 
 like me as UNK-2 making the breakfast for i he can make it for UNK-67 im sure 
 im not going to take in UNK-39 off the street for him if he takes 
 a UNK-170 of a house like this id love to have a long talk with an 
 intelligent UNK-914 person id have to get a nice pair of red 
 UNK-193 like those UNK-597 with the UNK-908 used to sell or yellow and a 
 nice UNK-21 morning UNK-748 that i badly want or a UNK-300

 his hands in the side pockets of his UNK-748 grey suit . that was a belt 
 round his pocket . and belt was also to give a fellow a belt . one day a 
 fellow said to UNK-866 
 UNK-0 
 id give you such a belt in a second . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-866 had answered 
 UNK-0 
 go and fight your match . give UNK-836 thunder a belt . id like to see 
 you . UNK-25 give you a toe in the UNK-442 for yourself . 
 UNK-0 
 that was not a nice expression . his mother had told him not to speak 
 with the rough boys in the college . nice mother ! the first day in the 
 hall of the castle when she had said UNK-244 she had put up her UNK-296 
 double to her nose to kiss him and her nose and eyes were red . but he 
 had UNK-204 not to see that she was going to cry . she was a nice 
 mother but she was not so nice when she UNK-5 . and his father had given 
 him two UNK-203 pieces for pocket money . and his father had told 
 him if he wanted anything to write home to him and whatever he did 
 never to UNK-117 on a fellow . then at the door of the castle the UNK-96 
 had UNK-491 hands with his father and mother his UNK-825 UNK-923 in 
 the UNK-226 and the car had driven off with his father and mother on 
 it . they had UNK-5 to him from the car UNK-343 their hands 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-244 stephen UNK-244 ! 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-244 stephen UNK-244 ! 
 UNK-0 
 he was caught in the UNK-208 of a UNK-797 and UNK-883 of the flashing 
 eyes and UNK-249 boots bent down to look through the legs . the UNK-13 
 were UNK-875 and UNK-388 and their legs were UNK-166 and UNK-325 
 and UNK-349 . then jack UNK-136 yellow boots UNK-716 out the ball and 
 all the other boots and legs ran after . he ran after them a little way 
 and then stopped . it was UNK-453 to run on . soon they would be going 
 home for the holidays . after UNK-255 in the study hall he would change 
 the number UNK-339 up inside his desk from UNK-409 to UNK-222 . 
 UNK-0 
 it would be better to be in the study hall than out there in the cold . 
 the sky was pale and cold but there were lights in the castle . he 
 UNK-105 from which window hamilton UNK-596 had thrown his hat on the 
 UNK-430 and had there been UNK-710 at that time under the windows . one 
 day when he had been called to the castle the butler had shown him the 
 marks of the soldiers UNK-639 in the wood of the door and had given him 
 a piece of UNK-801 that the community ate . it was nice and warm to 
 see the lights in the castle . it was like something in a book . perhaps 
 UNK-381 UNK-497 was like that . and there were nice sentences in doctor 
 UNK-776 spelling book . they were like poetry but they were only 
 sentences to learn the spelling from . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-944 died in UNK-381 UNK-497 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  where the UNK-433 buried him . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-239 is a disease of plants 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  cancer one of animals . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 it would be nice to lie on the UNK-350 before the fire UNK-200 his 
 head upon his hands and think on those sentences . he UNK-364 as if he 
 had cold UNK-415 water next his skin . that was mean of wells to shoulder 
 him into the square UNK-791 because he would not UNK-516 his little UNK-68 
 box for UNK-751 UNK-224 UNK-461 UNK-360 the UNK-757 of forty . how 
 cold and UNK-415 the water had been ! a fellow had once seen a big rat 
 jump into the UNK-974 . mother was sitting at the fire with UNK-68 waiting 
 for UNK-270 to bring in the tea . she had her feet on the UNK-153 and her 
 UNK-542 UNK-193 were so hot and they had such a lovely warm smell ! 
 UNK-68 knew a lot of things . she had taught him where the mozambique 
 channel was and what was the longest river in america and what was the 
 name of the highest mountain in the moon . father UNK-297 knew more than 
 UNK-68 because he was a priest but both his father and uncle charles 
 said that UNK-68 was a UNK-324 woman and a UNK-710 woman . and when 
 UNK-68 made that noise after dinner and then put up her hand to her 
 mouth that was UNK-713 . 
 UNK-0 
 a voice UNK-5 far out on the UNK-578 
 UNK-0 
 all in ! 
 UNK-0 
 then other voices UNK-5 from the lower and third lines 
 UNK-0 
 all in ! all in ! 
 UNK-0 
 the players closed around UNK-327 and UNK-249 and he went among them 
 glad to go in . UNK-369 UNK-833 held the ball by its UNK-830 lace . a fellow 
 asked him to give it one last but he walked on without even answering 
 the fellow . simon UNK-729 told him not to because the UNK-89 was 
 looking . the fellow turned to simon UNK-729 and said 
 UNK-0 
 we all know why you speak . you are UNK-76 suck . 
 UNK-0 
 suck was a UNK-81 word . the fellow called simon UNK-729 that name because 
 simon UNK-729 used to tie the UNK-881 false UNK-552 behind his back 
 and the UNK-89 used to let on to be angry . but the sound was ugly . 
 once he had UNK-466 his hands in the UNK-220 of the UNK-777 hotel and 
 his father pulled the UNK-393 up by the chain after and the dirty water 
 went down through the hole in the basin . and when it had all gone down 
 slowly the hole in the basin had made a sound like that suck . only 
 UNK-339 . 
 UNK-0 
 to remember that and the white look of the UNK-220 made him feel cold 
 and then hot . there were two cocks that you turned and water came out 
 cold and hot . he felt cold and then a little hot and he could see the 
 names printed on the cocks . that was a very UNK-81 thing . 
 UNK-0 
 and the air in the UNK-366 UNK-35 him too . it was UNK-81 and UNK-307 . 
 but soon the gas would be lit and in burning it made a light noise like 
 a little song . always the same and when the UNK-13 stopped talking in 
 the UNK-833 you could hear it . 
 UNK-0 
 it was the hour for UNK-994 . father UNK-297 wrote a hard sum on the board 
 and then said 
 UNK-0 
 now then who will win ? go ahead york ! go ahead lancaster ! 
 UNK-0 
 stephen tried his best but the sum was too hard and he felt confused . 
 the little silk badge with the white rose on it that was UNK-774 on the 
 breast of his jacket began to UNK-782 . he was no good at UNK-994 but he 
 tried his best so that york might not lose . father UNK-785 face looked 
 very black but he was not in a wax he was laughing . then jack UNK-835 
 UNK-871 his fingers and father UNK-297 looked at his UNK-721 and said 
 UNK-0 
 right . UNK-296 lancaster ! the red rose wins . come on now york ! forge 
 ahead ! 
 UNK-0 
 jack UNK-835 looked over from his side . the little silk badge with the 
 red rose on it looked very rich because he had a blue UNK-99 top on . 
 stephen felt his own face red too thinking of all the UNK-998 about who 
 would get first place in elements jack UNK-835 or he . some weeks jack 
 UNK-835 got the card for first and some weeks he got the card for first . 
 his white silk badge UNK-894 and UNK-894 as he worked at the next 
 sum and heard father UNK-785 voice . then all his UNK-700 passed away 
 and he felt his face quite cool . he thought his face must be white 
 because it felt so cool . he could not get out the answer for the sum 
 but it did not matter . white roses and red roses those were beautiful 
 colours to think of . and the cards for first place and second place and 
 third place were beautiful colours too pink and cream and UNK-534 . 
 UNK-534 and cream and pink roses were beautiful to think of . perhaps a 
 wild rose might be like those colours and he remembered the song about 
 the wild rose UNK-685 on the little green place . but you could not 
 have a green rose . but perhaps somewhere in the world you could . 
 UNK-0 
 the bell UNK-459 and then the classes began to file out of the rooms and 
 along the UNK-158 towards the UNK-686 . he sat looking at the two 
 prints of butter on his plate but could not eat the UNK-261 bread . the 
 UNK-275 was UNK-261 and UNK-544 . but he UNK-59 off the hot weak tea which 
 the UNK-713 UNK-305 UNK-99 with a white UNK-99 UNK-207 into his cup . he 
 UNK-105 whether the UNK-677 UNK-99 was UNK-261 too or whether all white 
 things were cold and UNK-261 . nasty UNK-200 and UNK-293 UNK-59 UNK-323 that 
 their people sent them in UNK-336 . they said they could not drink the tea 
 that it was UNK-934 . their fathers were UNK-221 the UNK-13 said . 
 UNK-0 
 all the boys seemed to him very strange . they had all fathers and 
 mothers and different clothes and voices . he UNK-405 to be at home and 
 lay his head on his mothers lap . but he could not and so he UNK-405 
 for the play and study and prayers to be over and to be in bed . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-59 another cup of hot tea and UNK-132 said 
 UNK-0 
 whats up ? have you a pain or whats up with you ? 
 UNK-0 
 i dont know stephen said . 
 UNK-0 
 sick in your UNK-709 UNK-132 said because your face looks 
 white . it will go away . 
 UNK-0 
 o yes stephen said . 
 UNK-0 
 but he was not sick there . he thought that he was sick in his heart if 
 you could be sick in that place . UNK-132 was very decent to ask him . he 
 wanted to cry . he UNK-122 his UNK-122 on the table and shut and opened 
 the UNK-166 of his ears . then he heard the noise of the UNK-686 every 
 time he opened the UNK-166 of his ears . it made a UNK-612 like a train at 
 night . and when he closed the UNK-166 the UNK-612 was shut off like a train 
 going into a tunnel . that night at UNK-54 the train had UNK-172 like 
 that and then when it went into the tunnel the UNK-612 stopped . he 
 closed his eyes and the train went on UNK-710 and then stopping 
 UNK-710 again stopping . it was nice to hear it UNK-612 and stop and then 
 UNK-612 out of the tunnel again and then stop . 
 UNK-0 
 then the higher line UNK-13 began to come down along the UNK-340 in 
 the middle of the UNK-686 UNK-65 UNK-990 and jimmy UNK-107 and the 
 UNK-877 who was allowed to smoke UNK-765 and the little portuguese who 
 UNK-71 the UNK-471 cap . and then the lower line tables and the tables of 
 the third line . and every single fellow had a different way of walking . 
 UNK-0 
 he sat in a corner of the UNK-833 UNK-438 to watch a game of 
 UNK-271 and once or twice he was able to hear for an instant the 
 little song of the gas . the UNK-89 was at the door with some boys and 
 simon UNK-729 was UNK-637 his false UNK-552 . he was telling them 
 something about UNK-387 . 
 UNK-0 
 then he went away from the door and wells came over to stephen and 
 said 
 UNK-0 
 tell us UNK-1 do you kiss your mother before you go to bed ? 
 UNK-0 
 stephen answered 
 UNK-0 
 i do . 
 UNK-0 
 wells turned to the other UNK-13 and said 
 UNK-0 
 o i say UNK-182 a fellow says he UNK-854 his mother every night 
 before he goes to bed . 
 UNK-0 
 the other UNK-13 stopped their game and turned round laughing . 
 stephen UNK-134 under their eyes and said 
 UNK-0 
 i do not . 
 UNK-0 
 wells said 
 UNK-0 
 o i say UNK-182 a fellow says he UNK-55 kiss his mother before he 
 goes to bed . 
 UNK-0 
 they all UNK-20 again . stephen tried to laugh with them . he felt his 
 whole body hot and confused in a moment . what was the right answer to 
 the question ? he had given two and still wells UNK-20 . but wells must 
 know the right answer for he was in third of grammar . he tried to think 
 of UNK-751 mother but he did not dare to raise his eyes to UNK-751 
 face . he did not like UNK-751 face . it was wells who had UNK-506 him 
 into the square UNK-791 the day before because he would not UNK-516 his 
 little UNK-68 box for UNK-751 UNK-224 UNK-461 UNK-360 the UNK-757 
 of forty . it was a mean thing to do all the UNK-13 said it was . and 
 how cold and UNK-415 the water had been ! and a fellow had once seen a big 
 rat jump UNK-267 into the UNK-974 . 
 UNK-0 
 the cold UNK-124 of the UNK-791 covered his whole body and when the bell 
 UNK-459 for study and the lines filed out of the UNK-93 he felt the 
 cold air of the UNK-366 and UNK-116 inside his clothes . he still 
 tried to think what was the right answer . was it right to kiss his 
 mother or wrong to kiss his mother ? what did that mean to kiss ? you 
 put your face up like that to say good night and then his mother put 
 her face down . that was to kiss . his mother put her lips on his UNK-139 
 her lips were soft and they UNK-108 his UNK-139 and they made a tiny 
 little noise kiss . why did people do that with their two faces ? 
 UNK-0 
 sitting in the study hall he opened the lid of his desk and changed the 
 number UNK-339 up inside from UNK-409 to UNK-222 . but the 
 christmas vacation was very far away but one time it would come 
 because the earth moved round always . 
 UNK-0 
 there was a picture of the earth on the first page of his geography a 
 big ball in the middle of clouds . UNK-132 had a box of UNK-80 and one 
 night during free study he had UNK-332 the earth green and the clouds 
 UNK-569 . that was like the two UNK-842 in UNK-47 press the brush with 
 the green velvet back for UNK-121 and the brush with the UNK-569 velvet 
 back for michael UNK-281 . but he had not told UNK-132 to colour them 
 those colours . UNK-132 had done it himself . 
 UNK-0 
 he opened the geography to study the lesson but he could not learn the 
 names of places in america . still they were all different places that 
 had different names . they were all in different countries and the 
 countries were in UNK-520 and the UNK-520 were in the world and 
 the world was in the universe . 
 UNK-0 
 he turned to the UNK-155 of the geography and read what he had written 
 there himself his name and where he was . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  stephen UNK-1 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  class of elements 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-202 wood college 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-432 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  county UNK-328 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  ireland 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  europe 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  the world 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  the universe 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 that was in his writing and UNK-132 one night for a cod had written on 
 the opposite page 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  stephen UNK-1 is my name 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  ireland is my nation . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-202 is my UNK-532 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  and heaven my UNK-312 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he read the UNK-351 UNK-940 but then they were not poetry . then he 
 read the UNK-155 from the bottom to the top till he came to his own 
 name . that was he and he read down the page again . what was after the 
 universe ? 
 UNK-0 
 nothing . but was there anything round the universe to show where it 
 stopped before the nothing place began ? 
 UNK-0 
 it could not be a wall but there could be a thin thin line there all 
 round everything . it was very big to think about everything and 
 everywhere . only god could do that . he tried to think what a big 
 thought that must be but he could only think of god . god was gods 
 name just as his name was stephen . UNK-18 was the french for god and that 
 was gods name too and when anyone UNK-124 to god and said UNK-18 then 
 god knew at once that it was a french person that was UNK-725 . but 
 though there were different names for god in all the different 
 languages in the world and god understood what all the people who 
 UNK-124 said in their different languages still god remained always the 
 same god and gods real name was god . 
 UNK-0 
 it made him very tired to think that way . it made him feel his head 
 very big . he turned over the UNK-155 and looked UNK-853 at the green 
 round earth in the middle of the UNK-569 clouds . he UNK-105 which was 
 right to be for the green or for the UNK-569 because UNK-68 had UNK-7 
 the green velvet back off the brush that was for UNK-121 one day with 
 her UNK-868 and had told him that UNK-121 was a bad man . he UNK-105 
 if they were UNK-957 at home about that . that was called politics . 
 there were two sides in it UNK-68 was on one side and his father and mr 
 casey were on the other side but his mother and uncle charles were on 
 no side . every day there was something in the paper about it . 
 UNK-0 
 it UNK-588 him that he did not know well what politics meant and that he 
 did not know where the universe ended . he felt small and weak . when 
 would he be like the UNK-13 in poetry and UNK-308 ? they had big 
 voices and big boots and they studied UNK-826 . that was very far 
 away . first came the vacation and then the next term and then vacation 
 again and then again another term and then again the vacation . it was 
 like a train going in and out of UNK-564 and that was like the noise of 
 the boys eating in the UNK-686 when you opened and closed the UNK-166 
 of the ears . term vacation tunnel out noise stop . how far away it 
 was ! it was better to go to bed to sleep . only prayers in the chapel 
 and then bed . he UNK-364 and UNK-7 . it would be lovely in bed after 
 the sheets got a bit hot . first they were so cold to get into . he 
 UNK-364 to think how cold they were first . but then they got hot and 
 then he could sleep . it was lovely to be tired . he UNK-7 again . night 
 prayers and then bed he UNK-364 and wanted to UNK-83 . it would be 
 lovely in a few minutes . he felt a warm glow UNK-420 up from the cold 
 UNK-384 sheets UNK-199 and UNK-199 till he felt warm all over ever so 
 warm and yet he UNK-364 a little and still wanted to UNK-83 . 
 UNK-0 
 the bell UNK-459 for night prayers and he filed out of the study hall 
 after the others and down the UNK-116 and along the UNK-158 to the 
 chapel . the UNK-158 were UNK-326 lit and the chapel was UNK-326 lit . 
 soon all would be dark and sleeping . there was cold night air in the 
 chapel and the UNK-525 were the colour the sea was at night . the sea 
 was cold day and night but it was UNK-822 at night . it was cold and 
 dark under the UNK-19 beside his fathers house . but the UNK-767 would 
 be on the UNK-182 to make punch . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-89 of the chapel UNK-124 above his head and his memory knew the 
 responses 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  o lord open our lips 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  and our UNK-682 shall announce thy praise . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-284 unto our aid o god ! 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  o lord make UNK-803 to help us ! 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 there was a cold night smell in the chapel . but it was a holy smell . it 
 was not like the smell of the old UNK-926 who UNK-97 at the back of the 
 chapel at sunday mass . that was a smell of air and rain and UNK-474 and 
 UNK-359 . but they were very holy UNK-926 . they UNK-98 behind him on 
 his neck and UNK-279 as they UNK-124 . they lived in UNK-166 a fellow said 
 there were little cottages there and he had seen a woman standing at 
 the UNK-725 of a cottage with a child in her arms as the cars had 
 come past from UNK-432 . it would be lovely to sleep for one night in 
 that cottage before the fire of smoking UNK-474 in the dark lit by the 
 fire in the warm dark breathing the smell of the UNK-926 air and 
 rain and UNK-474 and UNK-359 . but o the road there between the trees 
 was dark ! you would be lost in the dark . it made him afraid to think 
 of how it was . 
 UNK-0 
 he heard the voice of the UNK-89 of the chapel saying the last 
 prayers . he UNK-124 it too against the dark outside under the trees . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  visit we UNK-172 thee o lord this UNK-111 and drive 
 UNK-0  away from it all the UNK-175 of the enemy . may thy holy 
 UNK-0  angels UNK-790 herein to preserve us in peace and may thy 
 UNK-0  UNK-586 be always upon us through christ our lord . 
 UNK-0  UNK-294 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 his fingers UNK-515 as he UNK-753 himself in the UNK-773 . he told 
 his fingers to UNK-282 up . he had to UNK-511 and then UNK-456 and say his 
 own prayers and be in bed before the gas was UNK-42 so that he might 
 not go to hell when he died . he rolled his stockings off and put on his 
 UNK-734 quickly and UNK-97 UNK-178 at his UNK-453 and repeated his 
 prayers quickly UNK-143 that the gas would go down . he felt his 
 UNK-61 UNK-144 as he UNK-203 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  god bless my father and my mother and spare them to me ! 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  god bless my little brothers and sisters and spare them to me ! 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  god bless UNK-68 and uncle charles and spare them to me ! 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he blessed himself and UNK-350 quickly into bed and UNK-138 the end of 
 the UNK-734 under his feet UNK-827 himself together under the cold 
 white sheets UNK-144 and UNK-178 . but he would not go to hell when 
 he died and the UNK-144 would stop . a voice UNK-432 the boys in the 
 UNK-773 good night . he UNK-427 out for an instant over the UNK-391 
 and saw the yellow UNK-790 round and before his bed that shut him off 
 on all sides . the light was UNK-42 UNK-40 . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-881 shoes went away . where ? down the UNK-116 and along the 
 UNK-158 or to his room at the end ? he saw the dark . was it true about 
 the black dog that walked there at night with eyes as big as 
 UNK-902 ? they said it was the ghost of a UNK-1 . a long UNK-485 
 of fear UNK-760 over his body . he saw the dark entrance hall of the 
 castle . old UNK-478 in old dress were in the UNK-586 above the 
 UNK-116 . it was long ago . the old UNK-478 were quiet . there was a 
 fire there but the hall was still dark . a figure came up the UNK-116 
 from the hall . he UNK-71 the white UNK-382 of a UNK-212 his face was pale 
 and strange he held his hand pressed to his side . he looked out of 
 strange eyes at the old UNK-478 . they looked at him and saw their 
 masters face and UNK-382 and knew that he had received his UNK-152 . 
 but only the dark was where they looked only dark silent air . their 
 master had received his UNK-152 on the battlefield of prague far 
 away over the sea . he was standing on the field his hand was pressed 
 to his side his face was pale and strange and he UNK-71 the white UNK-382 
 of a UNK-212 . 
 UNK-0 
 o how cold and strange it was to think of that ! all the dark was cold 
 and strange . there were pale strange faces there great eyes like 
 UNK-902 . they were the UNK-738 of UNK-316 the figures of 
 UNK-81 who had received their UNK-152 on UNK-863 far away 
 over the sea . what did they wish to say that their faces were so 
 strange ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 visit we UNK-172 thee o lord this UNK-111 and drive away from it 
 all . . . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 going home for the holidays ! that would be lovely the UNK-13 had told 
 him . getting up on the cars in the early UNK-646 morning outside the 
 door of the castle . the cars were rolling on the UNK-59 . cheers for the 
 UNK-96 ! 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-419 ! UNK-419 ! UNK-419 ! 
 UNK-0 
 the cars drove past the chapel and all caps were raised . they drove 
 UNK-314 along the country roads . the drivers pointed with their UNK-102 
 to UNK-182 . the UNK-13 UNK-78 . they passed the UNK-717 
 of the UNK-236 farmer . UNK-897 after UNK-897 after UNK-897 . through UNK-166 they 
 drove UNK-29 and UNK-78 . the UNK-720 women stood at the UNK-457 
 the men stood here and there . the lovely smell there was in the UNK-646 
 air the smell of UNK-166 rain and UNK-646 air and UNK-474 UNK-120 and 
 UNK-359 . 
 UNK-0 
 the train was full of UNK-13 a long long chocolate train with cream 
 UNK-487 . the guards went to and UNK-161 opening closing locking 
 UNK-944 the doors . they were men in dark blue and silver they had 
 UNK-89 UNK-851 and their keys made a quick music click click

 UNK-0 
 UNK-304 . . . 
 UNK-0 
 there was a noise of UNK-442 running back along the UNK-494 of 
 water being UNK-967 in the UNK-17 . there was a noise of rising and 
 dressing and washing in the UNK-773 a noise of UNK-374 of hands as 
 the UNK-89 went up and down telling the UNK-13 to look sharp . a pale 
 UNK-252 showed the yellow UNK-790 drawn back the UNK-481 beds . his 
 bed was very hot and his face and body were very hot . 
 UNK-0 
 he got up and sat on the side of his bed . he was weak . he tried to pull 
 on his UNK-261 . it had a UNK-353 rough feel . the UNK-252 was UNK-81 and 
 cold . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-132 said 
 UNK-0 
 are you not well ? 
 UNK-0 
 he did not know and UNK-132 said 
 UNK-0 
 get back into bed . ill tell UNK-790 UNK-14 not well . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-2 sick . 
 UNK-0 
 who is ? 
 UNK-0 
 tell UNK-790 . 
 UNK-0 
 get back into bed . 
 UNK-0 
 is he sick ? 
 UNK-0 
 a fellow held his arms while he UNK-420 the UNK-261 UNK-862 to his 
 foot and UNK-350 back into the hot bed . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-752 down between the sheets glad of their UNK-724 glow . he heard 
 the UNK-13 talk among themselves about him as they dressed for mass . 
 it was a mean thing to do to shoulder him into the square UNK-791 they 
 were saying . 
 UNK-0 
 then their voices UNK-167 they had gone . a voice at his bed said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-1 dont spy on us sure you UNK-19 ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-751 face was there . he looked at it and saw that wells was afraid . 
 UNK-0 
 i UNK-3 mean to . sure you UNK-19 ? 
 UNK-0 
 his father had told him whatever he did never to UNK-117 on a fellow . 
 he UNK-35 his head and answered no and felt glad . 
 UNK-0 
 wells said 
 UNK-0 
 i UNK-3 mean to UNK-88 bright . it was only for cod . im sorry . 
 UNK-0 
 the face and the voice went away . sorry because he was afraid . afraid 
 that it was some disease . UNK-239 was a disease of plants and cancer one 
 of animals or another different . that was a long time ago then out on 
 the UNK-615 in the evening light UNK-420 from point to point on 
 the UNK-703 of his line a heavy bird flying low through the grey light . 
 UNK-381 UNK-497 lit up . UNK-944 died there . the UNK-433 buried him 
 themselves . 
 UNK-0 
 it was not UNK-751 face it was the UNK-881 . he was not UNK-274 . no 
 no he was sick really . he was not UNK-274 . and he felt the UNK-881 
 hand on his UNK-133 and he felt his UNK-133 warm and UNK-261 against 
 the UNK-881 cold UNK-261 hand . that was the way a rat felt UNK-415 and 
 UNK-261 and cold . every rat had two eyes to look out of . UNK-553 UNK-415 
 UNK-811 little little feet UNK-852 up to jump black UNK-415 eyes to look 
 out of . they could understand how to jump . but the minds of rats could 
 not understand UNK-826 . when they were dead they lay on their 
 sides . their UNK-811 dried then . they were only dead things . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-89 was there again and it was his voice that was saying that 
 he was to get up that father minister had said he was to get up and 
 dress and go to the UNK-129 . and while he was dressing himself as 
 quickly as he could the UNK-89 said 
 UNK-0 
 we must pack off to brother michael because we have the 
 UNK-476 ! 
 UNK-0 
 he was very decent to say that . that was all to make him laugh . but he 
 could not laugh because his UNK-145 and lips were all UNK-83 and then 
 the UNK-89 had to laugh by himself . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-89 UNK-5 
 UNK-0 
 quick march ! UNK-996 ! UNK-746 ! 
 UNK-0 
 they went together down the UNK-116 and along the UNK-366 and past 
 the bath . as he passed the door he remembered with a UNK-209 fear the 
 warm UNK-451 UNK-647 the warm UNK-295 air the noise of UNK-819 
 the smell of the UNK-84 like medicine . 
 UNK-0 
 brother michael was standing at the door of the UNK-129 and from the 
 door of the dark cabinet on his right came a smell like medicine . that 
 came from the bottles on the UNK-891 . the UNK-89 spoke to brother 
 michael and brother michael answered and called the UNK-89 sir . he had 
 UNK-694 hair mixed with grey and a UNK-81 look . it was UNK-81 that he 
 would always be a brother . it was UNK-81 too that you could not call him 
 sir because he was a brother and had a different kind of look . was he 
 not holy enough or why could he not catch up on the others ? 
 UNK-0 
 there were two beds in the room and in one bed there was a fellow and 
 when they went in he called out 
 UNK-0 
 hello ! its young UNK-1 ! whats up ? 
 UNK-0 
 the sky is up brother michael said . 
 UNK-0 
 he was a fellow out of the third of grammar and while stephen was 
 UNK-808 he asked brother michael to bring him a round of UNK-236 
 UNK-550 . 
 UNK-0 
 ah do ! he said . 
 UNK-0 
 butter you up ! said brother michael . UNK-85 get your walking papers 
 in the morning when the doctor comes . 
 UNK-0 
 will i ? the fellow said . im not well yet . 
 UNK-0 
 brother michael repeated 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-85 get your walking papers . i tell you . 
 UNK-0 
 he bent down to UNK-780 the fire . he had a long back like the long back of 
 a UNK-283 . he UNK-35 the poker UNK-141 and UNK-146 his head at the 
 fellow out of third of grammar . 
 UNK-0 
 then brother michael went away and after a while the fellow out of 
 third of grammar turned in towards the wall and fell UNK-314 . 
 UNK-0 
 that was the UNK-129 . he was sick then . had they written home to tell 
 his mother and father ? but it would be UNK-496 for one of the UNK-73 
 to go himself to tell them . or he would write a letter for the priest 
 to bring . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  dear mother 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  i am sick . i want to go home . please come and take me home . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  i am in the UNK-129 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  your UNK-345 son 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  stephen 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 how far away they were ! there was cold UNK-252 outside the window . he 
 UNK-105 if he would die . you could die just the same on a sunny day . 
 he might die before his mother came . then he would have a dead mass in 
 the chapel like the way the UNK-13 had told him it was when little had 
 died . all the UNK-13 would be at the mass dressed in black all with 
 sad faces . wells too would be there but no fellow would look at him . 
 the UNK-96 would be there in a cope of black and gold and there would 
 be tall yellow candles on the UNK-92 and round the UNK-676 . and they 
 would carry the UNK-142 out of the chapel slowly and he would be buried 
 in the little UNK-963 of the community off the main avenue of UNK-673 . 
 and wells would be sorry then for what he had done . and the bell would 
 toll slowly . 
 UNK-0 
 he could hear the UNK-451 . he said over to himself the song that UNK-270 
 had taught him . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-51 ! the castle bell ! 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-399 my mother ! 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-721 me in the old UNK-339 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  beside my UNK-904 brother . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  my UNK-142 shall be black 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  six angels at my back 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  two to sing and two to pray 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  and two to carry my soul away . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 how beautiful and sad that was ! how beautiful the words were where they 
 said UNK-721 me in the old UNK-339 ! a UNK-673 passed over his body . how 
 sad and how beautiful ! he wanted to cry UNK-40 but not for himself 
 for the words so beautiful and sad like music . the bell ! the bell ! 
 UNK-399 ! o UNK-399 ! 
 UNK-0 
 the cold UNK-252 was UNK-664 and brother michael was standing at his 
 UNK-453 with a bowl of UNK-721 . he was glad for his mouth was hot and 
 dry . he could hear them playing in the UNK-615 . and the day was 
 going on in the college just as if he were there . 
 UNK-0 
 then brother michael was going away and the fellow out of the third of 
 grammar told him to be sure and come back and tell him all the news in 
 the paper . he told stephen that his name was UNK-535 and that his father 
 kept a lot of UNK-751 that were UNK-311 UNK-909 and that his father 
 would give a good tip to brother michael any time he wanted it because 
 brother michael was very decent and always told him the news out of the 
 paper they got every day up in the castle . there was every kind of news 
 in the paper accidents UNK-534 sports and politics . 
 UNK-0 
 now it is all about politics in the papers he said . do your people 
 talk about that too ? 
 UNK-0 
 yes stephen said . 
 UNK-0 
 mine too he said . 
 UNK-0 
 then he thought for a moment and said 
 UNK-0 
 you have a UNK-81 name UNK-1 and i have a UNK-81 name too UNK-535 . 
 my name is the name of a town . your name is like latin . 
 UNK-0 
 then he asked 
 UNK-0 
 are you good at UNK-680 ? 
 UNK-0 
 stephen answered 
 UNK-0 
 not very good . 
 UNK-0 
 then he said 
 UNK-0 
 can you answer me this one ? why is the county of UNK-328 like the 
 leg of a UNK-13 UNK-468 ? 
 UNK-0 
 stephen thought what could be the answer and then said 
 UNK-0 
 i give it up . 
 UNK-0 
 because there is a UNK-606 in it he said . do you see the joke ? UNK-535 
 is the town in the county UNK-328 and a UNK-606 is the other UNK-606 . 
 UNK-0 
 oh i see stephen said . 
 UNK-0 
 thats an old UNK-810 he said . 
 UNK-0 
 after a moment he said 
 UNK-0 
 i say ! 
 UNK-0 
 what ? asked stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 you know he said you can ask that UNK-810 another way . 
 UNK-0 
 can you ? said stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 the same UNK-810 he said . do you know the other way to ask it ? 
 UNK-0 
 no said stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 can you not think of the other way ? he said . 
 UNK-0 
 he looked at stephen over the UNK-562 as he spoke . then he lay back 
 on the pillow and said 
 UNK-0 
 there is another way but i UNK-19 tell you what it is . 
 UNK-0 
 why did he not tell it ? his father who kept the UNK-751 must be a 
 UNK-80 too like UNK-646 father and nasty UNK-936 father . he 
 thought of his own father of how he UNK-57 songs while his mother played 
 and of how he always gave him a UNK-378 when he asked for UNK-547 and 
 he felt sorry for him that he was not a UNK-80 like the other boys 
 fathers . then why was he sent to that place with them ? but 
 his father had told him that he would be no stranger there because his 
 UNK-694 had presented an address to the UNK-439 there fifty years 
 before . you could know the people of that time by their old dress . it 
 seemed to him a UNK-384 time and he UNK-105 if that was the time when 
 the UNK-13 in UNK-202 UNK-71 blue UNK-811 with brass buttons and yellow 
 UNK-643 and caps of UNK-411 and UNK-59 beer like UNK-503 people 
 and kept UNK-34 of their own to course the UNK-222 with . 
 UNK-0 
 he looked at the window and saw that the UNK-917 had grown UNK-664 . 
 there would be cloudy grey light over the UNK-615 . there was no 
 noise on the UNK-615 . the class must be doing the themes or perhaps 
 father UNK-297 was reading out of the book . 
 UNK-0 
 it was UNK-81 that they had not given him any medicine . perhaps brother 
 michael would bring it back when he came . they said you got UNK-372 
 stuff to drink when you were in the UNK-129 . but he felt better now 
 than before . it would be nice getting better slowly . you could get a 
 book then . there was a book in the library about holland . there were 
 lovely foreign names in it and pictures of strange looking cities and 
 ships . it made you feel so happy . 
 UNK-0 
 how pale the light was at the window ! but that was nice . the fire rose 
 and fell on the wall . it was like waves . someone had put coal on and he 
 heard voices . they were talking . it was the noise of the waves . or the 
 waves were talking among themselves as they rose and fell . 
 UNK-0 
 he saw the sea of waves long dark waves rising and falling dark under 
 the UNK-264 night . a tiny light UNK-914 at the UNK-47 where the 
 ship was entering and he saw a UNK-431 of people gathered by the 
 waters edge to see the ship that was entering their harbour . a tall 
 man stood on the deck looking out towards the flat dark land and by 
 the light at the UNK-47 he saw his face the UNK-564 face of 
 brother michael . 
 UNK-0 
 he saw him lift his hand towards the people and heard him say in a loud 
 voice of UNK-234 over the waters 
 UNK-0 
 he is dead . we saw him lying upon the UNK-676 . a UNK-673 of UNK-234 
 went up from the people . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-121 ! UNK-121 ! he is dead ! 
 UNK-0 
 they fell upon their UNK-111 UNK-86 in UNK-234 . 
 UNK-0 
 and he saw UNK-68 in a UNK-569 velvet dress and with a green velvet 
 UNK-939 hanging from her UNK-61 walking proudly and UNK-173 past the 
 people who UNK-97 by the waters edge . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 a great fire UNK-372 high and red UNK-970 in the UNK-886 and under the 
 UNK-194 branches of the UNK-164 the christmas table was spread . 
 they had come home a little late and still dinner was not ready but it 
 would be ready in a UNK-471 his mother had said . they were waiting for 
 the door to open and for the UNK-478 to come in holding the big 
 dishes covered with their heavy metal covers . 
 UNK-0 
 all were waiting uncle charles who sat far away in the shadow of the 
 window UNK-68 and mr casey who sat in the UNK-292 at either side 
 of the UNK-679 stephen UNK-154 on a chair between them his feet 
 UNK-807 on the UNK-24 boss . mr UNK-1 looked at himself in the 
 UNK-526 above the UNK-425 UNK-22 out his UNK-91 ends and then 
 UNK-370 his UNK-965 stood with his back to the UNK-808 fire and 
 still from time to time he UNK-740 a hand from his UNK-725 to wax 
 out one of his UNK-91 ends . mr casey UNK-122 his head to one side 
 and UNK-21 UNK-408 the UNK-691 of his neck with his fingers . and 
 stephen UNK-24 too for he knew now that it was not true that mr casey 
 had a purse of silver in his throat . he UNK-24 to think how the UNK-89 
 noise which mr casey used to make had UNK-901 him . and when he had 
 tried to open mr UNK-25 hand to see if the purse of silver was hidden 
 there he had seen that the fingers could not be UNK-195 out and 
 mr casey had told him that he had got those three UNK-738 fingers 
 making a birthday present for queen victoria . mr casey UNK-408 the UNK-691 
 of his neck and UNK-24 at stephen with UNK-638 eyes and mr UNK-1 said 
 to him 
 UNK-0 
 yes . well now thats all right . o we had a good walk UNK-180 we 
 john ? yes . . . i wonder if UNK-6 any likelihood of dinner this evening . 
 yes . . . o well now we got a good breath of ozone round the head today . UNK-42 
 UNK-79 . 
 UNK-0 
 he turned to UNK-68 and said 
 UNK-0 
 you UNK-3 UNK-94 out at all mrs UNK-577 ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-68 UNK-654 and said shortly 
 UNK-0 
 no . 
 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-1 dropped his UNK-965 and went over to the UNK-839 . he 
 brought forth a great stone jar of UNK-224 from the UNK-999 and filled 
 the UNK-933 slowly UNK-277 now and then to see how much he had UNK-207 
 in . then replacing the jar in the UNK-999 he UNK-207 a little of the 
 UNK-224 into two glasses added a little water and came back with them 
 to the fireplace . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-972 john he said just to UNK-215 your UNK-437 . 
 UNK-0 
 mr casey took the glass UNK-59 and placed it near him on the 
 UNK-425 . then he said 
 UNK-0 
 well i cant help thinking of our friend christopher manufacturing . . . 
 UNK-0 
 he broke into a fit of UNK-31 and UNK-14 and added 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 . . UNK-746 that champagne for those UNK-13 . 
 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-1 UNK-20 UNK-76 . 
 UNK-0 
 is it UNK-753 ? he said . UNK-6 more UNK-650 in one of those UNK-472 
 on his bald head than in a pack of jack UNK-235 . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-444 his head closed his eyes and licking his lips UNK-421 
 began to speak with the voice of the hotel UNK-430 . 
 UNK-0 
 and he has such a soft mouth when UNK-2 speaking to you dont you 
 know . UNK-2 very UNK-295 and UNK-138 about the UNK-974 god bless him . 
 UNK-0 
 mr casey was still UNK-875 through his fit of UNK-14 and UNK-31 . 
 stephen seeing and hearing the hotel UNK-430 through his fathers face 
 and voice UNK-20 . 
 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-1 put up his UNK-574 and UNK-151 down at him said UNK-40 
 and UNK-320 
 UNK-0 
 what are you laughing at you little puppy you ? 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-478 entered and placed the dishes on the table . mrs UNK-1 
 followed and the places were arranged . 
 UNK-0 
 sit over she said . 
 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-1 went to the end of the table and said 
 UNK-0 
 now mrs UNK-577 sit over . john sit you down my UNK-656 . 
 UNK-0 
 he looked round to where uncle charles sat and said 
 UNK-0 
 now then sir UNK-6 a bird here waiting for you . 
 UNK-0 
 when all had taken their seats he laid his hand on the cover and then 
 said quickly UNK-737 it 
 UNK-0 
 now stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen stood up in his place to say the grace before meals 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 bless us o lord and these thy gifts which through 
 thy UNK-161 we are about to receive through christ our 
 lord . UNK-294 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 all blessed themselves and mr UNK-1 with a UNK-317 of pleasure UNK-64 
 from the dish the heavy cover UNK-954 around the edge with UNK-985 
 drops . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen looked at the UNK-191 turkey which had UNK-89 UNK-822 and 
 UNK-166 on the kitchen table . he knew that his father had paid a 
 guinea for it in UNK-603 of UNK-615 street and that the man had UNK-680 
 it often at the UNK-444 to show how good it was and he remembered 
 the UNK-54 voice when he had said 
 UNK-0 
 take that one sir . thats the real UNK-65 UNK-954 . 
 UNK-0 
 why did mr UNK-517 in UNK-202 call his UNK-690 a turkey ? but 
 UNK-202 was far away and the warm heavy smell of turkey and ham and 
 UNK-461 rose from the plates and dishes and the great fire was UNK-372 
 high and red in the UNK-886 and the green UNK-390 and red holly made you feel 
 so happy and when dinner was ended the big UNK-94 UNK-494 would be 
 carried in UNK-635 with UNK-96 UNK-657 and UNK-323 of holly with 
 UNK-945 fire running around it and a little green flag flying from the 
 top . 
 UNK-0 
 it was his first christmas dinner and he thought of his little brothers 
 and sisters who were waiting in the nursery as he had often UNK-56 
 till the UNK-494 came . the deep low collar and the UNK-921 jacket made him 
 feel UNK-81 and UNK-51 and that morning when his mother had brought him 
 down to the UNK-309 dressed for mass his father had UNK-5 . that was 
 because he was thinking of his own father . and uncle charles had said 
 so too . 
 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-1 covered the dish and began to eat UNK-362 . then he said 
 UNK-0 
 poor old UNK-753 UNK-2 nearly UNK-244 now with UNK-633 . 
 UNK-0 
 simon said mrs UNK-1 you UNK-204 given mrs UNK-577 any sauce . 
 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-1 UNK-457 the UNK-500 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-204 i ? he UNK-5 . mrs UNK-577 UNK-47 the poor blind . UNK-68 covered 
 her plate with her hands and said 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-1 turned to uncle charles . 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0

 UNK-0

 UNK-0

 UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 he UNK-207 sauce freely over UNK-8 plate and set the boat again on 
 the table . then he asked uncle charles was it tender . uncle charles 
 could not speak because his mouth was full but he UNK-146 that it was . 
 UNK-0 
 that was a good answer our friend made to the canon . what ? said mr 
 UNK-1 . 
 UNK-0 
 i UNK-3 think he had that much in him said mr casey . 
 UNK-0 
 ill pay your UNK-76 father when you UNK-575 turning the house of god 
 into a UNK-121 . 
 UNK-0 
 a nice answer said UNK-68 for any man calling himself a catholic to 
 give to his priest . 
 UNK-0 
 they have only themselves to blame said mr UNK-1 UNK-338 . if they 
 took a UNK-972 advice they would UNK-564 their attention to religion . 
 UNK-0 
 it is religion UNK-68 said . they are doing their duty in warning the 
 people . 
 UNK-0 
 we go to the house of god mr casey said in all UNK-551 to pray to 
 our maker and not to hear election addresses . 
 UNK-0 
 it is religion UNK-68 said again . they are right . they must direct 
 their UNK-838 . 
 UNK-0 
 and UNK-867 politics from the UNK-92 is it ? asked mr UNK-1 . 
 UNK-0 
 certainly said UNK-68 . it is a question of public UNK-83 . a priest 
 would not be a priest if he did not tell his UNK-275 what is right and 
 what is wrong . 
 UNK-0 
 mrs UNK-1 laid down her knife and fork saying 
 UNK-0 
 for UNK-47 sake and for UNK-47 sake let us have no political discussion 
 on this day of all days in the year . 
 UNK-0 
 quite right UNK-772 said uncle charles . now simon thats quite 
 enough now . not another word now . 
 UNK-0 
 yes yes said mr UNK-1 quickly . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-300 the dish UNK-258 and said 
 UNK-0 
 now then UNK-169 for more turkey ? 
 UNK-0 
 nobody answered . UNK-68 said 
 UNK-0 
 nice language for any catholic to use ! 
 UNK-0 
 mrs UNK-577 i appeal to you said mrs UNK-1 to let the matter 
 drop now . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-68 turned on her and said 
 UNK-0 
 and am i to sit here and listen to the UNK-752 of my church being 
 UNK-560 ? 
 UNK-0 
 nobody is saying a word against them said mr UNK-1 so long as 
 they dont UNK-632 in politics . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-910 and UNK-73 of ireland have spoken said UNK-68 and they 
 must be UNK-759 . 
 UNK-0 
 let them leave politics alone said mr casey or the people may 
 leave their church alone . 
 UNK-0 
 you hear ? said UNK-68 turning to mrs UNK-1 . 
 UNK-0 
 mr casey ! simon ! said mrs UNK-1 let it end now . 
 UNK-0 
 too bad ! too bad ! said uncle charles . 
 UNK-0 
 what ? UNK-5 mr UNK-1 . were we to desert him at the bidding of the 
 english people ? 
 UNK-0 
 he was no longer worthy to lead said UNK-68 . he was a public UNK-473 . 
 UNK-0 
 we are all UNK-608 and black UNK-608 said mr casey UNK-482 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-726 be to the man by whom the UNK-47 UNK-298 ! said mrs UNK-577 . it 
 would be better for him that a UNK-623 were tied about his neck and 
 that he were cast into the UNK-855 of the sea rather than that he should 
 UNK-910 one of these my least little ones . that is the language of 
 the holy ghost . 
 UNK-0 
 and very bad language if you ask me said mr UNK-1 UNK-357 . 
 UNK-0 
 simon ! simon ! said uncle charles . the boy . 
 UNK-0 
 yes yes said mr UNK-1 . i meant about the . . . i was thinking about the 
 bad language of the railway porter . well now thats all right . here 
 stephen show me your plate old UNK-26 . eat away now . here . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-574 up the food on UNK-8 plate and served uncle charles and 
 mr casey to large pieces of turkey and UNK-966 of sauce . mrs UNK-1 
 was eating little and UNK-68 sat with her hands in her lap . she was red 
 in the face . mr UNK-1 UNK-868 with the UNK-475 at the end of the dish 
 and said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-6 a UNK-109 bit here we call the UNK-744 nose . if any lady or 
 gentleman . . . 
 UNK-0 
 he held a piece of UNK-918 up on the UNK-319 of the UNK-211 fork . nobody 
 spoke . he put it on his own plate saying 
 UNK-0 
 well you cant say but you were asked . i think i had better eat it 
 myself because im not well in my health lately . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-743 at stephen and replacing the UNK-405 began to eat again . 
 UNK-0 
 there was a silence while he ate . then he said 
 UNK-0 
 well now the day kept up fine after all . there were plenty of 
 UNK-76 down too . 
 UNK-0 
 nobody spoke . he said again 
 UNK-0 
 i think there were more UNK-76 down than last christmas . 
 UNK-0 
 he looked round at the others whose faces were bent towards their 
 plates and receiving no reply UNK-56 for a moment and said UNK-828 
 UNK-0 
 well my christmas dinner has been UNK-602 UNK-58 . 
 UNK-0 
 there could be neither luck nor grace UNK-68 said in a house where 
 there is no respect for the UNK-752 of the church . 
 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-1 UNK-163 his knife and fork UNK-267 on his plate . 
 UNK-0 
 respect ! he said . is it for billy with the lip or for the tub of 
 UNK-655 up in UNK-813 ? respect ! 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-424 of the church said mr casey with slow UNK-589 . 
 UNK-0 
 lord UNK-69 UNK-177 yes said mr UNK-1 . 
 UNK-0 
 they are the UNK-153 UNK-19 UNK-68 said . they are an UNK-88 to their 
 country . 
 UNK-0 
 tub of UNK-655 said mr UNK-1 UNK-612 . he has a UNK-218 face mind 
 you in UNK-835 . you should see that fellow UNK-252 up his bacon and 
 UNK-388 of a cold UNK-495 day . o johnny ! 
 UNK-0 
 he twisted his features into a UNK-782 of heavy bestiality and made a 
 UNK-252 noise with his lips . 
 UNK-0 
 really simon you should not speak that way before stephen . its 
 not right . 
 UNK-0 
 o hell remember all this when he grows up said UNK-68 UNK-74 
 language he heard against god and religion and UNK-73 in his own home . 
 UNK-0 
 let him remember too UNK-5 mr casey to her from across the table 
 the language with which the UNK-73 and the UNK-73 UNK-402 broke 
 UNK-855 heart and UNK-573 him into his grave . let him remember that 
 too when he grows up . 
 UNK-0 
 sons of UNK-898 ! UNK-5 mr UNK-1 . when he was down they turned on 
 him to UNK-488 him and UNK-835 him like rats in a UNK-669 . UNK-224 dogs ! 
 and they look it ! by christ they look it ! 
 UNK-0 
 they UNK-472 UNK-793 UNK-5 UNK-68 . they UNK-759 their UNK-910 and 
 their UNK-73 . UNK-88 to them ! 
 UNK-0 
 well it is perfectly UNK-348 to say that not even for one day in 
 the year said mrs UNK-1 can we be free from these UNK-348 
 disputes ! 
 UNK-0 
 uncle charles raised his hands UNK-124 and said 
 UNK-0 
 come now come now come now ! can we not have our opinions whatever 
 they are without this bad UNK-933 and this bad language ? it is too bad 
 surely . 
 UNK-0 
 mrs UNK-1 spoke to UNK-68 in a low voice but UNK-68 said UNK-76 
 UNK-0 
 i will not say nothing . i will defend my church and my religion when 
 it is UNK-153 and UNK-750 on by UNK-395 UNK-535 . 
 UNK-0 
 mr casey pushed his plate UNK-394 into the middle of the table and 
 UNK-807 his UNK-122 before him said in a UNK-445 voice to his host 
 UNK-0 
 tell me did i tell you that story about a very famous UNK-750 ? 
 UNK-0 
 you did not john said mr UNK-1 . 
 UNK-0 
 why then said mr casey it is a most UNK-351 story . it happened 
 not long ago in the county UNK-777 where we are now . 
 UNK-0 
 he broke off and turning towards UNK-68 said with quiet UNK-360 
 UNK-0 
 and i may tell you UNK-772 that i if you mean me am no UNK-395 
 catholic . i am a catholic as my father was and his father before him 
 and his father before him again when we gave up our lives rather than 
 sell our faith . 
 UNK-0 
 the more shame to you now UNK-68 said to speak as you do . 
 UNK-0 
 the story john said mr UNK-1 UNK-21 . let us have the story 
 UNK-58 . 
 UNK-0 
 catholic indeed ! repeated UNK-68 UNK-496 . the UNK-817 UNK-560 
 in the land would not speak the language i have heard this evening . 
 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-1 began to UNK-178 his head to and UNK-161 UNK-657 like a country 
 singer . 
 UNK-0 
 i am no UNK-560 i tell you again said mr casey UNK-347 . 
 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-1 still UNK-657 and UNK-223 his head began to sing in a 
 UNK-585 UNK-116 tone 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  o come all you roman UNK-535 
 UNK-0  that never went to mass . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he took up his knife and fork again in good UNK-179 and set to eating 
 saying to mr casey 
 UNK-0 
 let us have the story john . it will help us to digest . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen looked with UNK-874 at mr UNK-25 face which UNK-156 across 
 the table over his joined hands . he liked to sit near him at the fire 
 looking up at his dark UNK-562 face . but his dark eyes were never UNK-562 
 and his slow voice was good to listen to . but why was he then against 
 the UNK-73 ? because UNK-68 must be right then . but he had heard his 
 father say that she was a UNK-602 UNK-642 and that she had come out of the 
 UNK-575 in the UNK-420 when her brother had got the money from the 
 UNK-32 for the UNK-808 and the UNK-276 . perhaps that made her severe 
 against UNK-121 . and she did not like him to play with UNK-174 because 
 UNK-174 was a UNK-560 and when she was young she knew children that 
 used to play with UNK-949 and the UNK-949 used to make fun of 
 the UNK-688 of the blessed virgin . tower of ivory they used to say 
 house of gold ! how could a woman be a tower of ivory or a house of 
 gold ? who was right then ? and he remembered the evening in the 
 UNK-129 in UNK-202 the dark waters the light at the UNK-47 and 
 the UNK-969 of UNK-234 from the people when they had heard . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-174 had long white hands . one evening when playing UNK-917 she had put 
 her hands over his eyes long and white and thin and cold and soft . 
 that was ivory a cold white thing . that was the meaning of tower of 
 ivory . 
 UNK-0 
 the story is very short and sweet mr casey said . it was one day 
 down in UNK-785 a cold UNK-412 day not long before the chief died . may 
 god have mercy on him ! 
 UNK-0 
 he closed his eyes UNK-853 and UNK-214 . mr UNK-1 took a bone from his 
 plate and UNK-814 some meat from it with his teeth saying 
 UNK-0 
 before he was killed you mean . 
 UNK-0 
 mr casey opened his eyes UNK-279 and went on 
 UNK-0 
 it was down in UNK-785 one day . we were down there at a meeting and 
 after the meeting was over we had to make our way to the railway 
 station through the crowd . such UNK-635 and UNK-548 man you never 
 heard . they called us all the names in the world . well there was one 
 old lady and a UNK-355 old UNK-762 she was surely that paid all her 
 attention to me . she kept dancing along beside me in the mud UNK-159 
 and UNK-121 into my face UNK-539 ! the paris funds ! mr fox ! 
 kitty UNK-348 ! 
 UNK-0 
 and what did you do john ? asked mr UNK-1 . 
 UNK-0 
 i let her UNK-643 away said mr casey . it was a cold day and to keep up 
 my heart i had saving your presence UNK-772 a UNK-260 of UNK-382 in my 
 mouth and sure i UNK-18 say a word in any case because my mouth was 
 full of tobacco juice . 
 UNK-0 
 well john ? 
 UNK-0 
 well . i let her UNK-643 away to her hearts content kitty UNK-348 and 
 the rest of it till at last she called that lady a name that i UNK-19 
 UNK-846 this christmas board nor your ears UNK-772 nor my own lips by 
 UNK-598 . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-214 . mr UNK-1 UNK-272 his head from the bone asked 
 UNK-0 
 and what did you do john ? 
 UNK-0 
 do ! said mr casey . she stuck her ugly old face up at me when she 
 said it and i had my mouth full of tobacco juice . i bent down to her 
 and UNK-62 ! says i to her like that . 
 UNK-0 
 he turned aside and made the act of UNK-199 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-62 ! says i to her like that right into her eye . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-27 his hand to his eye and gave a UNK-445 UNK-509 of pain . 
 UNK-0 
 o jesus mary and joseph ! says she . im UNK-911 ! im UNK-911 and 
 UNK-873 ! 
 UNK-0 
 he stopped in a fit of UNK-14 and UNK-31 UNK-598 
 UNK-0 
 im UNK-911 entirely . 
 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-1 UNK-20 UNK-76 and lay back in his chair while uncle charles 
 UNK-237 his head to and UNK-161 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-68 looked UNK-313 angry and repeated while they UNK-20 
 UNK-0 
 very nice ! ha ! very nice ! 
 UNK-0 
 it was not nice about the UNK-750 in the UNK-95 eye . 
 UNK-0 
 but what was the name the woman had called kitty UNK-348 that mr casey 
 would not repeat ? he thought of mr casey walking through the UNK-291 of 
 people and making speeches from a UNK-333 . that was what he had been 
 in prison for and he remembered that one night UNK-616 UNK-99 had 
 come to the house and had stood in the hall talking in a low voice 
 with his father and UNK-574 UNK-409 at the UNK-296 of his cap . and 
 that night mr casey had not gone to dublin by train but a car had come 
 to the door and he had heard his father say something about the 
 UNK-209 road . 
 UNK-0 
 he was for ireland and UNK-121 and so was his father and so was UNK-68 
 too for one night at the band on the UNK-60 she had hit a gentleman 
 on the head with her UNK-148 because he had taken off his hat when the 
 band played god save the queen at the end . 
 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-1 gave a UNK-713 of UNK-251 . 
 UNK-0 
 ah john he said . it is true for them . we are an UNK-4 
 UNK-280 race and always were and always will be till the end of 
 the chapter . 
 UNK-0 
 uncle charles UNK-35 his head saying 
 UNK-0 
 a bad business ! a bad business ! 
 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-1 repeated 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-280 UNK-221 race ! 
 UNK-0 
 he pointed to the portrait of his UNK-423 on the wall to his right . 
 UNK-0 
 do you see that old UNK-26 up there john ? he said . he was a good 
 UNK-843 when there was no money in the job . he was UNK-475 to death 
 as a UNK-443 . but he had a saying about our UNK-490 friends that he 
 would never let one of them put his two feet under his UNK-618 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-68 broke in UNK-551 
 UNK-0 
 if we are a UNK-280 race we ought to be proud of it ! they are the 
 apple of gods eye . touch them not says christ for they are the apple 
 of my eye . 
 UNK-0 
 and can we not love our country then ? asked mr casey . are we not to 
 follow the man that was born to lead us ? 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-229 to his country ! replied UNK-68 . a UNK-229 an UNK-300 ! 
 the UNK-73 were right to UNK-665 him . the UNK-73 were always the true 
 friends of ireland . 
 UNK-0 
 were they faith ? said mr casey . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-163 his fist on the table and UNK-449 UNK-551 UNK-847 one 
 finger after another . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-3 the UNK-910 of ireland UNK-488 us in the time of the union 
 when bishop UNK-197 presented an address of UNK-606 to the UNK-283 
 UNK-171 ? UNK-3 the UNK-910 and UNK-73 sell the UNK-297 of 
 their country in UNK-887 in return for catholic UNK-300 ? UNK-3 they 
 UNK-143 the UNK-514 movement from the UNK-544 and in the UNK-343 box ? 
 and UNK-3 they UNK-181 the UNK-460 of UNK-611 UNK-521 UNK-532 ? 
 UNK-0 
 his face was UNK-808 with anger and stephen felt the glow rise to his 
 own UNK-139 as the spoken words UNK-892 him . mr UNK-1 UNK-420 a UNK-533 
 of UNK-997 UNK-589 . 
 UNK-0 
 o by god he UNK-5 i forgot little old paul UNK-575 ! another apple 
 of gods eye ! 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-68 bent across the table and UNK-5 to mr casey 
 UNK-0 
 right ! right ! they were always right ! god and UNK-83 and religion 
 come first . 
 UNK-0 
 mrs UNK-1 seeing her excitement said to her 
 UNK-0 
 mrs UNK-577 dont UNK-333 yourself answering them . 
 UNK-0 
 god and religion before everything ! UNK-68 UNK-5 . god and religion 
 before the world . 
 UNK-0 
 mr casey raised his UNK-867 fist and brought it down on the table with 
 a crash . 
 UNK-0 
 very well then he UNK-247 UNK-171 if it comes to that no god for 
 ireland ! 
 UNK-0 
 john ! john ! UNK-5 mr UNK-1 UNK-103 his guest by the coat sleeve . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-68 UNK-156 across the table her UNK-145 UNK-144 . mr casey UNK-250 
 up from his chair and bent across the table towards her UNK-958 the 
 air from before his eyes with one hand as though he were UNK-375 aside 
 a UNK-626 . 
 UNK-0 
 no god for ireland ! he UNK-5 . we have had too much god in ireland . 
 away with god ! 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-170 ! devil ! UNK-266 UNK-68 starting to her feet and almost 
 UNK-199 in his face . 
 UNK-0 
 uncle charles and mr UNK-1 pulled mr casey back into his chair again 
 talking to him from both sides reasonably . he UNK-156 before him out of 
 his dark UNK-600 eyes UNK-598 
 UNK-0 
 away with god i say ! 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-68 UNK-753 her chair UNK-611 aside and left the table UNK-654 
 her UNK-470 which rolled slowly along the carpet and came to rest 
 against the foot of an UNK-176 . mrs UNK-1 rose quickly and 
 followed her towards the door . at the door UNK-68 turned round UNK-611 
 and UNK-247 down the room her UNK-145 UNK-327 and UNK-106 with rage 
 UNK-0 
 devil out of hell ! we won ! we UNK-880 him to death ! UNK-97 ! 
 UNK-0 
 the door UNK-144 behind her . 
 UNK-0 
 mr casey UNK-835 his arms from his holders suddenly UNK-170 his head on 
 his hands with a UNK-278 of pain . 
 UNK-0 
 poor UNK-121 ! he UNK-5 UNK-76 . my dead king ! 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-78 UNK-76 and UNK-828 . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen raising his UNK-327 face saw that his fathers eyes 
 were full of tears . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-13 talked together in little groups . 
 UNK-0 
 one fellow said 
 UNK-0 
 they were caught near the hill of UNK-152 . 
 UNK-0 
 who caught them ? 
 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-123 and the minister . they were on a car . the same fellow 
 added 
 UNK-0 
 a fellow in the higher line told me . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-132 asked 
 UNK-0 
 but why did they run away tell us ? 
 UNK-0 
 i know why UNK-836 thunder said . because they had UNK-134 cash out of 
 the UNK-176 room . 
 UNK-0 
 who UNK-134 it ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-984 brother . and they all went shares in it . 
 UNK-0 
 but that was UNK-511 . how could they have done that ? 
 UNK-0 
 a fat lot you know about it thunder ! wells said . i know why they 
 UNK-204 . 
 UNK-0 
 tell us why . 
 UNK-0 
 i was told not to wells said . 
 UNK-0 
 o go on wells all said . you might tell us . we UNK-19 let it out . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen bent forward his head to hear . wells looked round to see if 
 anyone was coming . then he said UNK-935 
 UNK-0 
 you know the UNK-92 wine they keep in the press in the UNK-531 ? 
 UNK-0 
 yes . 
 UNK-0 
 well they UNK-59 that and it was found out who did it by the smell . 
 and thats why they ran away if you want to know . 
 UNK-0 
 and the fellow who had spoken first said 
 UNK-0 
 yes thats what i heard too from the fellow in the higher line . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-13 all were silent . stephen stood among them afraid to speak 
 listening . a UNK-90 UNK-309 of UNK-994 made him feel weak . how could they 
 have done that ? he thought of the dark silent UNK-531 . there were dark 
 wooden UNK-381 there where the UNK-782 UNK-57 lay UNK-40 UNK-177 . it 
 was not the chapel but still you had to speak under your breath . it was 
 a holy place . he remembered the summer evening he had been there to be 
 dressed as UNK-390 the evening of the UNK-643 to the little 
 UNK-92 in the wood . a strange and holy place . the boy that held the 
 UNK-188 had UNK-414 it UNK-64 by the middle chain to keep the UNK-918 
 lighting . that was called UNK-360 and it had UNK-416 UNK-40 as the 
 fellow had UNK-414 it gently and had given off a weak UNK-878 smell . and 
 then when all were UNK-534 he had stood holding out the boat to the 
 UNK-96 and the UNK-96 had put a UNK-741 of UNK-402 in it and it had 
 UNK-717 on the red UNK-918 . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-13 were talking together in little groups here and there on 
 the UNK-578 . the UNK-13 seemed to him to have grown smaller that 
 was because a UNK-576 had UNK-442 him down the day before a fellow 
 out of second of grammar . he had been thrown by the UNK-13 machine 
 UNK-79 on the UNK-592 path and his UNK-815 had been broken in three 
 pieces and some of the UNK-775 of the UNK-186 had gone into his mouth . 
 UNK-0 
 that was why the UNK-13 seemed to him smaller and UNK-199 away and the 
 UNK-665 so thin and far and the soft grey sky so high up . but there 
 was no play on the football grounds for cricket was coming and some 
 said that barnes would be UNK-457 and some said it would be flowers . and 
 all over the UNK-615 they were playing UNK-117 and bowling 
 UNK-553 and UNK-300 . and from here and from there came the sounds of the 
 cricket UNK-430 through the soft grey air . they said pick pack UNK-203 
 UNK-171 little drops of water in a fountain slowly falling in the 
 UNK-296 bowl . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-535 who had been silent said UNK-40 
 UNK-0 
 you are all wrong . 
 UNK-0 
 all turned towards him UNK-433 . 
 UNK-0 
 why ? 
 UNK-0 
 do you know ? 
 UNK-0 
 who told you ? 
 UNK-0 
 tell us UNK-535 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-535 pointed across the UNK-578 to where simon UNK-729 was walking by 
 himself UNK-325 a stone before him . 
 UNK-0 
 ask him he said . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-13 looked there and then said 
 UNK-0 
 why him ? 
 UNK-0 
 is he in it ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-535 UNK-42 his voice and said 
 UNK-0 
 do you know why those UNK-13 UNK-204 ? i will tell you but you must not 
 let on you know . 
 UNK-0 
 tell us UNK-535 . go on . you might if you know . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-214 for a moment and then said UNK-930 
 UNK-0 
 they were caught with simon UNK-729 and UNK-689 UNK-715 in the square one 
 night . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-13 looked at him and asked 
 UNK-0 
 caught ? 
 UNK-0 
 what doing ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-535 said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-474 . 
 UNK-0 
 all the UNK-13 were silent and UNK-535 said 
 UNK-0 
 and thats why . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen looked at the faces of the UNK-13 but they were all looking 
 across the UNK-578 . he wanted to ask somebody about it . what did 
 that mean about the UNK-474 in the square ? why did the five UNK-13 
 out of the higher line run away for that ? it was a joke he thought . 
 simon UNK-729 had nice clothes and one night he had shown him a ball of 
 UNK-65 UNK-240 that the UNK-13 of the football fifteen had rolled down 
 to him along the carpet in the middle of the UNK-686 when he was at 
 the door . it was the night of the match against the UNK-43 rangers 
 and the ball was made just like a red and green apple only it opened 
 and it was full of the UNK-65 UNK-240 . and one day UNK-715 had said that 
 an elephant had two UNK-512 instead of two UNK-800 and that was why he 
 was called UNK-689 UNK-715 but some UNK-13 called him lady UNK-715 because 
 he was always at his nails UNK-537 them . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-174 had long thin cool white hands too because she was a girl . they 
 were like ivory only soft . that was the meaning of tower of ivory but 
 UNK-949 could not understand it and made fun of it . one day he had 
 stood beside her looking into the hotel grounds . a UNK-738 was running 
 up a trail of UNK-529 on the UNK-576 and a fox UNK-617 was UNK-243 
 to and UNK-161 on the sunny lawn . she had put her hand into his pocket 
 where his hand was and he had felt how cool and thin and soft her hand 
 was . she had said that pockets were funny things to have and then all 
 of a sudden she had broken away and had run laughing down the UNK-576 
 curve of the path . her fair hair had UNK-984 out behind her like gold 
 in the sun . tower of ivory . house of gold . by thinking of things you 
 could understand them . 
 UNK-0 
 but why in the square ? you went there when you wanted to do something . 
 it was all thick UNK-435 of UNK-283 and water UNK-749 all day out of tiny 
 UNK-142 and there was a UNK-81 smell of UNK-377 water there . and behind 
 the door of one of the UNK-761 there was a drawing in red pencil of a 
 UNK-663 man in a roman dress with a brick in each hand and UNK-733 
 was the name of the drawing 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-704 was building a wall . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 some fellow had drawn it there for a cod . it had a funny face but it 
 was very like a man with a UNK-153 . and on the wall of another UNK-277 
 there was written in UNK-828 in beautiful writing 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-734 UNK-856 wrote the UNK-421 belly . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 perhaps that was why they were there because it was a place where some 
 UNK-13 wrote things for cod . but all the same it was UNK-81 what UNK-535 
 said and the way he said it . it was not a cod because they had run 
 away . he looked with the others across the UNK-578 and began to feel 
 afraid . 
 UNK-0 
 at last UNK-132 said 
 UNK-0 
 and we are all to be UNK-344 for what other UNK-13 did ? 
 UNK-0 
 i UNK-19 come back see if i do UNK-836 thunder said . three days silence 
 in the UNK-686 and sending us up for six and eight every minute . 
 UNK-0 
 yes said wells . and old UNK-517 has a new way of UNK-990 the note 
 so that you cant open it and fold it again to see how many UNK-484 you 
 are to get . i UNK-19 come back too . 
 UNK-0 
 yes said UNK-836 thunder and the UNK-89 of studies was in second of 
 grammar this morning . 
 UNK-0 
 let us get up a UNK-693 UNK-132 said . will we ? 
 UNK-0 
 all the UNK-13 were silent . the air was very silent and you could hear 
 the cricket UNK-430 but more slowly than before pick UNK-203 . 
 UNK-0 
 wells asked 
 UNK-0 
 what is going to be done to them ? 
 UNK-0 
 simon UNK-729 and UNK-689 are going to be UNK-193 UNK-535 said and the 
 UNK-13 in the higher line got their choice of UNK-469 or being 
 UNK-507 . 
 UNK-0 
 and which are they taking ? asked the fellow who had spoken first . 
 UNK-0 
 all are taking UNK-549 except UNK-371 UNK-535 answered . UNK-2 going 
 to be UNK-193 by mr UNK-123 . 
 UNK-0 
 i know why UNK-836 thunder said . he is right and the other UNK-13 
 are wrong because a UNK-469 UNK-665 off after a bit but a fellow that 
 has been UNK-507 from college is known all his life on account of it . 
 besides UNK-123 UNK-19 UNK-914 him hard . 
 UNK-0 
 its best of his play not to UNK-132 said . 
 UNK-0 
 i UNK-9 like to be simon UNK-729 and UNK-689 UNK-836 thunder said . 
 but i dont believe they will be UNK-193 . perhaps they will be sent up 
 for twice nine . 
 UNK-0 
 no no said UNK-535 . UNK-450 both get it on the vital spot . wells 
 UNK-866 himself and said in a UNK-273 voice 
 UNK-0 
 please sir let me off ! 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-535 UNK-629 and turned up the UNK-552 of his jacket saying 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  it cant be helped 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  it must be done . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  so down with your UNK-468 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  and out with your UNK-300 . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-13 UNK-20 but he felt that they were a little afraid . in the 
 silence of the soft grey air he heard the cricket UNK-430 from here and 
 from there UNK-203 . that was a sound to hear but if you were hit then you 
 would feel a pain . the UNK-690 made a sound too but not like that . the 
 UNK-13 said it was made of UNK-527 and leather with lead inside and 
 he UNK-105 what was the pain like . there were different kinds of 
 sounds . a long thin UNK-330 would have a high UNK-604 sound and he 
 UNK-105 what was that pain like . it made him UNK-83 to think of it 
 and cold and what UNK-535 said too . but what was there to laugh at in it ? 
 it made him UNK-83 but that was because you always felt like a UNK-485 
 when you let down your UNK-48 . it was the same in the bath when you 
 UNK-753 yourself . he UNK-105 who had to let them down the master or 
 the boy himself . o how could they laugh about it that way ? 
 UNK-0 
 he looked at UNK-610 UNK-595 UNK-552 and UNK-249 UNK-826 hands . he had 
 rolled up his UNK-552 to show how mr UNK-123 would roll up his UNK-552 . 
 but mr UNK-123 had round UNK-222 UNK-625 and clean white UNK-982 and UNK-921 
 white hands and the nails of them were long and pointed . perhaps he 
 UNK-720 them too like lady UNK-715 . but they were UNK-313 long and pointed 
 nails . so long and UNK-165 they were though the white UNK-921 hands were 
 not UNK-165 but gentle . and though he UNK-515 with cold and UNK-512 to 
 think of the UNK-165 long nails and of the high UNK-604 sound of the UNK-330 
 and of the UNK-915 you felt at the end of your shirt when you UNK-753 
 yourself yet he felt a feeling of UNK-81 quiet pleasure inside him to think 
 of the white UNK-921 hands clean and strong and gentle . and he thought of 
 what UNK-836 thunder had said that mr UNK-123 would not UNK-914 UNK-371 hard . 
 and UNK-132 had said he would not because it was best of his play not 
 to . but that was not why 
 UNK-0 
 a voice from far out on the UNK-578 UNK-5 
 UNK-0 
 all in ! 
 UNK-0 
 and other voices UNK-5 
 UNK-0 
 all in ! all in ! 
 UNK-0 
 during the writing lesson he sat with his arms UNK-177 listening to the 
 slow UNK-958 of the pens . mr UNK-393 went to and UNK-161 making little 
 signs in red pencil and sometimes sitting beside the boy to show him 
 how to hold his pen . he had tried to spell out the headline for himself 
 though he knew already what it was for it was the last of the book . 
 UNK-432 without UNK-861 is like a ship UNK-702 . but the lines of the 
 letters were like fine invisible threads and it was only by closing his 
 right eye tight and UNK-151 out of the left eye that he could make out 
 the full curves of the capital . 
 UNK-0 
 but mr UNK-393 was very decent and never got into a wax . all the other 
 masters got into UNK-348 UNK-609 . but why were they to suffer for what 
 UNK-13 in the higher line did ? wells had said that they had drunk some 
 of the UNK-92 wine out of the press in the UNK-531 and that it had been 
 found out who had done it by the smell . perhaps they had stolen a 
 UNK-745 to run away with and sell it somewhere . that must have been 
 a terrible sin to go in there UNK-40 at night to open the dark press 
 and steal the flashing gold thing into which god was put on the UNK-92 
 in the middle of flowers and candles at UNK-806 while the UNK-402 
 went up in clouds at both sides as the fellow UNK-414 the UNK-188 and 
 UNK-999 kelly UNK-57 the first part by himself in the choir . but god was 
 not in it of course when they UNK-273 it . but still it was a strange and 
 a great sin even to touch it . he thought of it with deep UNK-994 a 
 terrible and strange sin it UNK-892 him to think of it in the silence 
 when the pens UNK-634 UNK-79 . but to drink the UNK-92 wine out of the 
 press and be found out by the smell was a sin too but it was not 
 terrible and strange . it only made you feel a little UNK-483 on account 
 of the smell of the wine . because on the day when he had made his first 
 holy UNK-415 in the chapel he had shut his eyes and opened his mouth 
 and put out his tongue a little and when the UNK-96 had UNK-109 down 
 to give him the holy UNK-415 he had UNK-616 a UNK-90 UNK-222 smell off the 
 UNK-176 breath after the wine of the mass . the word was beautiful 
 wine . it made you think of dark purple because the UNK-712 were dark 
 purple that grew in greece outside houses like white UNK-97 . but the 
 UNK-90 smell of the UNK-176 breath had made him feel a sick feeling on 
 the morning of his first UNK-415 . the day of your first UNK-415 was 
 the UNK-459 day of your life . and once a lot of UNK-925 had asked 
 UNK-471 what was the UNK-459 day of his life . they thought he would 
 say the day he won some great battle or the day he was made an emperor . 
 but he said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-32 the UNK-459 day of my life was the day on which i made 
 my first holy UNK-415 . 
 UNK-0 
 father UNK-297 came in and the latin lesson began and he remained still 
 UNK-200 on the desk with his arms UNK-177 . father UNK-297 gave out the 
 UNK-875 and he said that they were UNK-399 and that they were 
 all to be written out again with the corrections at once . but the worst 
 of all was UNK-144 theme because the pages were stuck together by a 
 UNK-306 and father UNK-297 held it up by a corner and said it was an 
 UNK-651 to any master to send him up such a theme . then he asked jack 
 UNK-835 to decline the UNK-498 UNK-488 and jack UNK-835 stopped at the UNK-501 
 UNK-663 and could not go on with the UNK-559 . 
 UNK-0 
 you should be UNK-252 of yourself said father UNK-297 UNK-867 . you 
 the leader of the class ! 
 UNK-0 
 then he asked the next boy and the next and the next . nobody knew . 
 father UNK-297 became very quiet more and more quiet as each boy tried 
 to answer it and could not . but his face was UNK-777 and 
 his eyes were UNK-151 though his voice was so quiet . then he asked 
 UNK-132 and UNK-132 said that the word had no UNK-559 . father UNK-297 
 suddenly shut the book and UNK-247 at him 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-456 out there in the middle of the class . you are one of the 
 UNK-218 boys i ever met . copy out your themes again the rest of you . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-132 moved heavily out of his place and UNK-97 between the two last 
 UNK-674 . the other boys bent over their UNK-875 and began to write . 
 a silence filled the classroom and stephen UNK-220 UNK-686 at father 
 UNK-785 dark face saw that it was a little red from the wax he was in . 
 UNK-0 
 was that a sin for father UNK-297 to be in a wax or was he allowed to 
 get into a wax when the boys were idle because that made them study 
 better or was he only letting on to be in a wax ? it was because he was 
 allowed because a priest would know what a sin was and would not do 
 it . but if he did it one time by mistake what would he do to go to 
 UNK-343 ? perhaps he would go to UNK-343 to the minister . and if 
 the minister did it he would go to the UNK-96 and the UNK-96 to the 
 provincial and the provincial to the general of the UNK-517 . that was 
 called the order and he had heard his father say that they were all 
 UNK-324 men . they could all have become UNK-750 people in the world if 
 they had not become UNK-517 . and he UNK-105 what father UNK-297 and 
 UNK-65 UNK-517 would have become and what mr UNK-790 and mr UNK-123 
 would have become if they had not become UNK-517 . it was hard to think 
 what because you would have to think of them in a different way with 
 different UNK-332 UNK-811 and UNK-48 and with UNK-913 and UNK-429 
 and different kinds of hats . 
 UNK-0 
 the door opened UNK-40 and closed . a quick UNK-365 ran through the 
 class the UNK-89 of studies . there was an instant of dead silence and 
 then the loud crack of a UNK-690 on the last desk . UNK-8 heart 
 UNK-87 up in fear . 
 UNK-0 
 any boys want UNK-469 here father UNK-297 ? UNK-5 the UNK-89 of 
 studies . any lazy idle UNK-949 that want UNK-469 in this class ? 
 UNK-0 
 he came to the middle of the class and saw UNK-132 on his UNK-111 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-75 ! he UNK-5 . who is this boy ? why is he on his UNK-111 ? what is 
 your name boy ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-132 sir . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-75 UNK-132 ! an UNK-657 of course . i can see it in your eye . why is 
 he on his UNK-111 father UNK-297 ? 
 UNK-0 
 he wrote a bad latin theme father UNK-297 said and he missed all 
 the questions in grammar . 
 UNK-0 
 of course he did ! UNK-5 the UNK-89 of studies of course he did ! a 
 born UNK-657 ! i can see it in the corner of his eye . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-794 his UNK-690 down on the desk and UNK-5 
 UNK-0 
 up UNK-132 ! up my boy ! 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-132 stood up slowly . 
 UNK-0 
 hold out ! UNK-5 the UNK-89 of studies . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-132 held out his hand . the UNK-690 came down on it with a loud 
 UNK-463 sound one two three four five six . 
 UNK-0 
 other hand ! 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-690 came down again in six loud quick UNK-260 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-456 down ! UNK-5 the UNK-89 of studies . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-132 UNK-97 down UNK-470 his hands under his UNK-672 his face 
 UNK-588 with pain but stephen knew how hard his hands were because 
 UNK-132 was always UNK-166 UNK-563 into them . but perhaps he was in great 
 pain for the noise of the UNK-690 was terrible . UNK-8 heart was 
 UNK-570 and UNK-923 . 
 UNK-0 
 at your work all of you ! UNK-247 the UNK-89 of studies . we want no 
 lazy idle UNK-949 here lazy idle little UNK-640 . at your work i tell 
 you . father UNK-338 will be in to see you every day . father UNK-338 will be 
 in tomorrow . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-549 one of the boys in the side with his UNK-690 saying 
 UNK-0 
 you boy ! when will father UNK-338 be in again ? 
 UNK-0 
 tomorrow sir said tom UNK-436 voice . 
 UNK-0 
 tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow said the UNK-89 of studies . 
 make up your minds for that . every day father UNK-338 . write away . you 
 boy who are you ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-8 heart UNK-615 suddenly . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-1 sir . 
 UNK-0 
 why are you not writing like the others ? 
 UNK-0 
 i . . UNK-846 . . . 
 UNK-0 
 he could not speak with UNK-512 . 
 UNK-0 
 why is he not writing father UNK-297 ? 
 UNK-0 
 he broke his glasses said father UNK-297 and i UNK-601 him from 
 work . 
 UNK-0 
 broke ? what is this i hear ? what is this ? your name is ! said the 
 UNK-89 of studies . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-1 sir . 
 UNK-0 
 out here UNK-1 . lazy little UNK-789 . i see UNK-789 in your face . 
 where did you break your glasses ? 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-886 into the middle of the class UNK-911 by fear and UNK-803 . 
 UNK-0 
 where did you break your glasses ? repeated the UNK-89 of studies . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-242 sir . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-75 ! the UNK-242 ! UNK-5 the UNK-89 of studies . i know that trick . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-64 his eyes in wonder and saw for a moment father UNK-453 
 UNK-634 not young face his UNK-109 UNK-634 head with UNK-393 at the 
 sides of it the steel UNK-226 of his UNK-815 and his UNK-884 eyes 
 looking through the glasses . why did he say he knew that trick ? 
 UNK-0 
 lazy idle little UNK-64 ! UNK-5 the UNK-89 of studies . broke my 
 glasses ! an old UNK-413 trick ! out with your hand this moment ! 
 UNK-0 
 stephen closed his eyes and held out in the air his UNK-178 hand with 
 the palm UNK-356 . he felt the UNK-89 of studies touch it for a moment 
 at the fingers to UNK-532 it and then the UNK-430 of the sleeve of the 
 UNK-825 as the UNK-690 was UNK-64 to strike . a hot burning UNK-358 
 UNK-567 blow like the loud crack of a broken stick made his UNK-178 
 hand UNK-932 together like a leaf in the fire and at the sound and the 
 pain UNK-180 tears were driven into his eyes . his whole body was UNK-144 
 with UNK-512 his arm was UNK-144 and his UNK-298 burning UNK-460 hand UNK-35 
 like a loose leaf in the air . a cry UNK-418 to his lips a prayer to be let 
 off . but though the tears UNK-326 his eyes and his UNK-477 UNK-643 with 
 pain and UNK-512 he held back the hot tears and the cry that UNK-326 his 
 throat . 
 UNK-0 
 other hand ! UNK-247 the UNK-89 of studies . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen drew back his UNK-826 and UNK-106 right arm and held out his 
 left hand . the UNK-825 sleeve UNK-491 again as the UNK-690 was UNK-64 
 and a loud UNK-330 sound and a UNK-562 UNK-92 UNK-567 burning pain 
 made his hand UNK-943 together with the UNK-976 and fingers in a UNK-460 
 UNK-106 mass . the UNK-180 water burst forth from his eyes and 
 burning with shame and UNK-386 and fear he drew back his UNK-144 arm in 
 terror and burst out into a UNK-714 of pain . his body UNK-35 with a UNK-89 
 of UNK-512 and in shame and rage he felt the UNK-180 cry come from his 
 throat and the UNK-180 tears falling out of his eyes and down his 
 UNK-600 UNK-145 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-456 down UNK-5 the UNK-89 of studies . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-97 down quickly pressing his UNK-309 hands to his sides . to 
 think of them UNK-309 and UNK-672 with pain all in a moment made him 
 feel so sorry for them as if they were not his own but someone UNK-117 
 that he felt sorry for . and as he UNK-97 UNK-71 the last UNK-319 in his 
 throat and feeling the burning UNK-567 pain pressed into his sides he 
 thought of the hands which he had held out in the air with the UNK-976 up 
 and of the firm touch of the UNK-89 of studies when he had UNK-740 
 the UNK-144 fingers and of the UNK-309 UNK-672 UNK-673 mass of palm and 
 fingers that UNK-35 UNK-538 in the air . 
 UNK-0 
 get at your work all of you UNK-5 the UNK-89 of studies from the 
 door . father UNK-338 will be in every day to see if any boy any lazy 
 idle little UNK-64 wants UNK-469 . every day . every day . 
 UNK-0 
 the door closed behind him . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-606 class continued to copy out the themes . father UNK-297 rose 
 from his seat and went among them helping the boys with gentle words 
 and telling them the mistakes they had made . his voice was very gentle 
 and soft . then he returned to his seat and said to UNK-132 and stephen 
 UNK-0 
 you may return to your places you two . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-132 and stephen rose and walking to their seats sat down . 
 stephen UNK-205 with shame opened a book quickly with one weak hand 
 and bent down upon it his face close to the page . 
 UNK-0 
 it was UNK-384 and UNK-165 because the doctor had told him not to read 
 without glasses and he had written home to his father that morning to 
 send him a new pair . and father UNK-297 had said that he need not study 
 till the new glasses came . then to be called a UNK-789 before the class 
 and to be UNK-154 when he always got the card for first or second and 
 was the leader of the UNK-14 ! how could the UNK-89 of studies know 
 that it was a trick ? he felt the touch of the UNK-881 fingers as they 
 had UNK-740 his hand and at first he had thought he was going to shake 
 hands with him because the fingers were soft and firm but then in an 
 instant he had heard the UNK-430 of the UNK-825 sleeve and the crash . it 
 was UNK-165 and UNK-384 to make him UNK-456 in the middle of the class then 
 and father UNK-297 had told them both that they might return to their 
 places without making any difference between them . he UNK-126 to 
 father UNK-785 low and gentle voice as he corrected the themes . 
 perhaps he was sorry now and wanted to be decent . but it was UNK-384 and 
 UNK-165 . the UNK-89 of studies was a priest but that was UNK-165 and 
 UNK-384 . and his UNK-634 face and the UNK-884 eyes behind the 
 UNK-645 UNK-815 were UNK-165 looking because he had UNK-740 the 
 hand first with his firm soft fingers and that was to hit it better and 
 UNK-339 . 
 UNK-0 
 its a UNK-372 mean thing thats what it is said UNK-132 in the 
 UNK-366 as the classes were passing out in file to the UNK-686 to 
 UNK-453 a fellow for what is not his fault . 
 UNK-0 
 you really broke your glasses by accident UNK-3 you ? nasty UNK-200 
 asked . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen felt his heart filled by UNK-144 words and did not answer . 
 UNK-0 
 of course he did ! said UNK-132 . i UNK-9 stand it . id go up and 
 tell the UNK-96 on him . 
 UNK-0 
 yes said UNK-836 thunder UNK-433 and i saw him lift the UNK-690 
 over his shoulder and UNK-2 not allowed to do that . 
 UNK-0 
 did they hurt you much ? nasty UNK-200 asked . 
 UNK-0 
 very much stephen said . 
 UNK-0 
 i UNK-9 stand it UNK-132 repeated from UNK-60 or any other 
 UNK-60 . its a UNK-372 mean low trick thats what it is . id go 
 straight up to the UNK-96 and tell him about it after dinner . 
 UNK-0 
 yes do . yes do said UNK-836 thunder . 
 UNK-0 
 yes do . yes go up and tell the UNK-96 on him UNK-1 said nasty 
 UNK-200 because he said that UNK-25 come in tomorrow again and UNK-453 you . 
 UNK-0 
 yes yes . tell the UNK-96 all said . 
 UNK-0 
 and there were some UNK-13 out of second of grammar listening and one 
 of them said 
 UNK-0 
 the senate and the roman people declared that UNK-1 had been 
 UNK-84 UNK-344 . 
 UNK-0 
 it was wrong it was UNK-384 and UNK-165 and as he sat in the UNK-686 
 he suffered time after time in memory the same UNK-396 until he 
 began to wonder whether it might not really be that there was something 
 in his face which made him look like a UNK-789 and he UNK-136 he had a 
 little mirror to see . but there could not be and it was UNK-259 and 
 UNK-165 and UNK-384 . 
 UNK-0 
 he could not eat the UNK-612 fish UNK-797 they got on UNK-79 in 
 UNK-256 and one of his potatoes had the mark of the UNK-917 in it . yes he 
 would do what the UNK-13 had told him . he would go up and tell the 
 UNK-96 that he had been UNK-84 UNK-344 . a thing like that had been 
 done before by somebody in history by some great person whose head was 
 in the books of history . and the UNK-96 would declare that he had been 
 UNK-84 UNK-344 because the senate and the roman people always 
 declared that the men who did that had been UNK-84 UNK-344 . those 
 were the great men whose names were in UNK-431 UNK-841 questions . 
 history was all about those men and what they did and that was what 
 peter UNK-404 tales about greece and rome were all about . peter UNK-860 
 himself was on the first page in a picture . there was a road over a 
 heath with grass at the side and little UNK-818 and peter UNK-860 had a 
 broad hat like a UNK-560 minister and a big stick and he was walking 
 fast along the road to greece and rome . 
 UNK-0 
 it was easy what he had to do . all he had to do was when the dinner was 
 over and he came out in his turn to go on walking but not out to the 
 UNK-366 but up the UNK-116 on the right that led to the castle . he 
 had nothing to do but that to turn to the right and walk fast up the 
 UNK-116 and in half a minute he would be in the low dark narrow 
 UNK-366 that led through the castle to the UNK-176 room . and every 
 fellow had said that it was UNK-384 even the fellow out of second of 
 grammar who had said that about the senate and the roman people . 
 UNK-0 
 what would happen ? 
 UNK-0 
 he heard the UNK-13 of the higher line stand up at the top of the 
 UNK-686 and heard their steps as they came down the UNK-340 UNK-65 
 UNK-990 and jimmy UNK-107 and the UNK-877 and the portuguese and the fifth 
 was big UNK-371 who was going to be UNK-193 by mr UNK-123 . that was 
 why the UNK-89 of studies had called him a UNK-789 and UNK-154 him for 
 nothing and UNK-50 his weak eyes tired with the tears he watched 
 big UNK-938 broad UNK-61 and big hanging black head passing in the 
 file . but he had done something and besides mr UNK-123 would not UNK-914 him 
 hard and he remembered how big UNK-371 looked in the bath . he had skin 
 the same colour as the UNK-451 UNK-647 in the UNK-502 end of the 
 bath and when he walked along the side his feet UNK-50 UNK-76 on the wet 
 tiles and at every step his UNK-932 UNK-35 a little because he was fat . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-686 was half empty and the UNK-13 were still passing out in 
 file . he could go up the UNK-116 because there was never a priest or 
 a UNK-89 outside the UNK-686 door . but he could not go . the UNK-96 
 would side with the UNK-89 of studies and think it was a UNK-413 
 trick and then the UNK-89 of studies would come in every day the same 
 only it would be worse because he would be UNK-441 UNK-944 at any 
 fellow going up to the UNK-96 about him . the UNK-13 had told him to go 
 but they would not go themselves . they had forgotten all about it . no 
 it was best to forget all about it and perhaps the UNK-89 of studies 
 had only said he would come in . no it was best to hide out of the way 
 because when you were small and young you could often escape that way . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-13 at his table stood up . he stood up and passed out among 
 them in the file . he had to decide . he was coming near the door . if he 
 went on with the UNK-13 he could never go up to the UNK-96 because he 
 could not leave the UNK-578 for that . and if he went and was UNK-154 
 all the same all the UNK-13 would make fun and talk about young 
 UNK-1 going up to the UNK-96 to tell on the UNK-89 of studies . 
 UNK-0 
 he was walking down along the UNK-340 and he saw the door before him . 
 it was impossible he could not . he thought of the UNK-109 head of the 
 UNK-89 of studies with the UNK-165 UNK-884 eyes looking at him and 
 he heard the voice of the UNK-89 of studies asking him twice what his 
 name was . why could he not remember the name when he was told the first 
 time ? was he not listening the first time or was it to make fun out of 
 the name ? the great men in the history had names like that and nobody 
 made fun of them . it was his own name that he should have made fun of 
 if he wanted to make fun . UNK-338 it was like the name of a woman who 
 UNK-466 clothes . 
 UNK-0 
 he had reached the door and turning quickly up to the right walked up 
 the UNK-93 and before he could make up his mind to come back he had 
 entered the low dark narrow UNK-366 that led to the castle . and as he 
 UNK-112 the threshold of the door of the UNK-366 he saw without 
 turning his head to look that all the UNK-13 were looking after him 
 as they went filing by . 
 UNK-0 
 he passed along the narrow dark UNK-366 passing little doors that 
 were the doors of the rooms of the community . he UNK-427 in front of him 
 and right and left through the UNK-286 and thought that those must be 
 portraits . it was dark and silent and his eyes were weak and tired with 
 tears so that he could not see . but he thought they were the portraits 
 of the saints and great men of the order who were looking down on him 
 UNK-173 as he passed saint UNK-77 UNK-337 holding an open book and 
 pointing to the words ad UNK-232 UNK-954 UNK-768 in it saint francis 
 UNK-124 pointing to his chest UNK-840 UNK-908 with his UNK-861 on his 
 head like one of the UNK-881 of the lines the three UNK-62 of holy 
 UNK-50 UNK-295 UNK-280 saint UNK-396 UNK-733 and blessed 
 john UNK-369 all with young faces because they died when they were 
 young and father peter kenny sitting in a chair wrapped in a big 
 UNK-382 . 
 UNK-0 
 he came out on the landing above the entrance hall and looked about 
 him . that was where hamilton UNK-596 had passed and the marks of the 
 soldiers UNK-639 were there . and it was there that the old UNK-478 had 
 seen the ghost in the white UNK-382 of a UNK-212 . 
 UNK-0 
 an old UNK-363 was UNK-31 at the end of the landing . he asked him 
 where was the UNK-176 room and the old UNK-363 pointed to the door at 
 the far end and looked after him as he went on to it and UNK-442 . 
 UNK-0 
 there was no answer . he UNK-442 again more UNK-76 and his heart UNK-615 
 when he heard a UNK-130 voice say 
 UNK-0 
 come in ! 
 UNK-0 
 he turned the handle and opened the door and UNK-148 for the handle of 
 the green UNK-86 door inside . he found it and pushed it open and went in . 
 UNK-0 
 he saw the UNK-96 sitting at a desk writing . there was a UNK-241 on the 
 desk and a strange UNK-384 smell in the room like the old leather of 
 chairs . 
 UNK-0 
 his heart was UNK-570 fast on account of the UNK-384 place he was in and 
 the silence of the room and he looked at the UNK-241 and at the UNK-176 
 UNK-770 face . 
 UNK-0 
 well my little man said the UNK-96 what is it ? 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-368 down the thing in his throat and said 
 UNK-0 
 i broke my glasses sir . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-96 opened his mouth and said 
 UNK-0 
 o ! 
 UNK-0 
 then he UNK-24 and said 
 UNK-0 
 well if we broke our glasses we must write home for a new pair . 
 UNK-0 
 i wrote home sir said stephen and father UNK-297 said i am not to 
 study till they come . 
 UNK-0 
 quite right ! said the UNK-96 . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-368 down the thing again and tried to keep his legs and 
 his voice from UNK-144 . 
 UNK-0 
 but sir 
 UNK-0 
 yes ? 
 UNK-0 
 father UNK-338 came in today and UNK-154 me because i was not writing 
 my theme . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-96 looked at him in silence and he could feel the blood rising 
 to his face and the tears about to rise to his eyes . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-96 said 
 UNK-0 
 your name is UNK-1 UNK-50 it ? 
 UNK-0 
 yes sir . . . 
 UNK-0 
 and where did you break your glasses ? 
 UNK-0 
 on the UNK-242 sir . a fellow was coming out of the bicycle 
 house and i fell and they got broken . i dont know the UNK-13 name . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-96 looked at him again in silence . then he UNK-24 and said 
 UNK-0 
 o well it was a mistake i am sure father UNK-338 did not know . 
 UNK-0 
 but i told him i broke them sir and he UNK-154 me . 
 UNK-0 
 did you tell him that you had written home for a new pair ? the 
 UNK-96 asked . 
 UNK-0 
 no sir . 
 UNK-0 
 o well then said the UNK-96 father UNK-338 did not understand . you can 
 say that i excuse you from your lessons for a few days . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen said quickly for fear his UNK-178 would prevent him 
 UNK-0 
 yes sir but father UNK-338 said he will come in tomorrow to UNK-453 me 
 again for it . 
 UNK-0 
 very well the UNK-96 said it is a mistake and i shall speak to 
 father UNK-338 myself . will that do now ? 
 UNK-0 
 stephen felt the tears UNK-93 his eyes and UNK-203 
 UNK-0 
 o yes sir thanks . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-96 held his hand across the side of the desk where the UNK-241 
 was and stephen placing his hand in it for a moment felt a cool UNK-295 
 palm . 
 UNK-0 
 good day now said the UNK-96 UNK-737 his hand and UNK-694 . 
 UNK-0 
 good day sir said stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-170 and walked UNK-40 out of the room closing the doors 
 carefully and slowly . 
 UNK-0 
 but when he had passed the old UNK-363 on the landing and was again in 
 the low narrow dark UNK-366 he began to walk faster and faster . faster 
 and faster he UNK-569 on through the UNK-286 UNK-92 . he UNK-896 his 
 UNK-213 against the door at the end and UNK-968 down the UNK-116 
 walked quickly through the two UNK-158 and out into the air . 
 UNK-0 
 he could hear the UNK-155 of the UNK-13 on the UNK-615 . he broke 
 into a run and running UNK-496 and UNK-496 ran across the UNK-242 
 and reached the third line UNK-578 UNK-572 . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-13 had seen him running . they closed round him in a ring 
 pushing one against another to hear . 
 UNK-0 
 tell us ! tell us ! 
 UNK-0 
 what did he say ? 
 UNK-0 
 did you go in ? 
 UNK-0 
 what did he say ? 
 UNK-0 
 tell us ! tell us ! 
 UNK-0 
 he told them what he had said and what the UNK-96 had said and when he 
 had told them all the UNK-13 UNK-168 their caps UNK-785 up into the 
 air and UNK-5 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-909 ! 
 UNK-0 
 they caught their caps and sent them up again UNK-785 UNK-808 and 
 UNK-5 again 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-909 ! UNK-909 ! 
 UNK-0 
 they made a cradle of their locked hands and UNK-605 him up among them 
 and carried him along till he UNK-250 to get free . and when he had 
 UNK-525 from them they broke away in all directions UNK-862 their 
 caps again into the air and UNK-604 as they went UNK-785 up and 
 UNK-273 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-909 ! 
 UNK-0 
 and they gave three UNK-633 for UNK-60 UNK-338 and three cheers for 
 UNK-29 and they said he was the UNK-679 UNK-96 that was ever in 
 UNK-202 . 
 UNK-0 
 the cheers died away in the soft grey air . he was alone . he was happy 
 and free but he would not be anyway proud with father UNK-338 . he would 
 be very quiet and UNK-887 and he UNK-136 that he could do something 
 kind for him to show him that he was not proud . 
 UNK-0 
 the air was soft and grey and mild and evening was coming . there was 
 the smell of evening in the air the smell of the fields in the country 
 where they UNK-359 up UNK-755 to UNK-215 them and eat them when they went 
 out for a walk to major UNK-487 the smell there was in the little 
 wood beyond the pavilion where the UNK-998 were . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-13 were UNK-617 long UNK-458 and bowling UNK-300 and slow 
 UNK-553 . in the soft grey silence he could hear the UNK-366 of the balls 
 and from here and from there through the quiet air the sound of the 
 cricket UNK-430 pick pack UNK-203 UNK-171 like drops of water in a fountain 
 falling UNK-41 in the UNK-296 bowl .

 chapter UNK-67 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 uncle charles UNK-146 such black twist that at last his UNK-401 suggested 
 to him to enjoy his morning smoke in a little UNK-687 at the end of 
 the garden . 
 UNK-0 
 very good simon . all UNK-587 simon said the old man UNK-743 . 
 anywhere you like . the UNK-687 will do me UNK-348 it will be more 
 UNK-195 . 
 UNK-0 
 damn me said mr UNK-1 UNK-846 if i know how you can smoke such 
 UNK-277 awful tobacco . its like UNK-68 by god . 
 UNK-0 
 its very nice simon replied the old man . very cool and 
 UNK-516 . 
 UNK-0 
 every morning therefore uncle charles UNK-43 to his UNK-687 but 
 not before he had UNK-810 and UNK-30 UNK-19 his back hair and 
 UNK-30 and put on his tall hat . while he UNK-146 the UNK-233 of his tall 
 hat and the bowl of his pipe were just visible beyond the UNK-59 of the 
 UNK-687 door . his UNK-980 as he called the UNK-374 UNK-687 which he 
 shared with the cat and the garden tools served him also as a 
 UNK-662 and every morning he UNK-977 UNK-453 one of his 
 favourite songs o UNK-753 me a UNK-289 or blue eyes and golden hair or 
 the UNK-957 of UNK-922 while the grey and blue UNK-887 of smoke rose 
 slowly from his pipe and UNK-134 in the pure air . 
 UNK-0 
 during the first part of the summer in UNK-853 uncle charles was 
 UNK-8 constant companion . uncle charles was a UNK-703 old man with a 
 well UNK-58 skin UNK-574 features and white side UNK-304 . on week days 
 he did messages between the house in UNK-684 avenue and those shops 
 in the main street of the town with which the family dealt . stephen was 
 glad to go with him on these UNK-235 for uncle charles helped him very 
 UNK-869 to UNK-539 of whatever was exposed in open boxes and UNK-601 
 outside the counter . he would UNK-495 a UNK-335 of UNK-712 and UNK-483 or 
 three or four american UNK-607 and UNK-243 them UNK-114 into his 
 UNK-544 hand while the UNK-166 UNK-24 UNK-523 and on UNK-8 
 UNK-945 UNK-767 to take them he would UNK-907 and say 
 UNK-0 
 take them sir . do you hear me sir ? UNK-30 good for your UNK-676 . 
 UNK-0 
 when the order list had been UNK-303 the two would go on to the park 
 where an old friend of UNK-8 father mike UNK-86 would be found 
 UNK-154 on a bench waiting for them . then would begin UNK-8 run 
 round the park . mike UNK-86 would stand at the gate near the railway 
 station watch in hand while stephen ran round the track in the style 
 mike UNK-86 UNK-992 his head high UNK-64 his UNK-111 well UNK-64 and 
 his hands held straight down by his sides . when the morning practice 
 was over the trainer would make his comments and sometimes UNK-341 
 them by UNK-910 along for a yard or so UNK-142 in an old pair of 
 blue canvas shoes . a small ring of UNK-315 children and UNK-142 
 would gather to watch him and UNK-552 even when he and uncle charles had 
 sat down again and were talking athletics and politics . though he had 
 heard his father say that mike UNK-86 had put some of the best UNK-113 
 of modern times through his hands stephen often UNK-75 at his 
 trainers UNK-492 UNK-544 face as it bent over the long UNK-567 
 fingers through which he rolled his cigarette and with UNK-47 at the 
 mild UNK-111 blue eyes which would look up suddenly from the task 
 and UNK-49 UNK-489 into the blue distance while the long UNK-672 fingers 
 UNK-167 their rolling and UNK-947 and UNK-484 of tobacco fell back into 
 the UNK-336 . 
 UNK-0 
 on the way home uncle charles would often pay a visit to the chapel 
 and as the font was above UNK-8 reach the old man would dip his 
 hand and then UNK-974 the water UNK-587 about UNK-8 clothes and on 
 the floor of the UNK-372 . while he UNK-124 he UNK-97 on his red 
 UNK-185 and read above his breath from a thumb UNK-73 prayer 
 book UNK-700 UNK-343 were printed at the foot of every page . stephen 
 UNK-97 at his side UNK-197 though he did not share his UNK-101 . he 
 often UNK-105 what his UNK-694 UNK-124 for so seriously . perhaps he 
 UNK-124 for the souls in UNK-758 or for the grace of a happy death or 
 perhaps he UNK-124 that god might send him back a part of the big 
 fortune he had UNK-553 in cork . 
 UNK-0 
 on UNK-822 stephen with his father and his UNK-694 took their 
 constitutional . the old man was a UNK-59 walker in UNK-300 of his UNK-710 
 and often ten or twelve miles of the road were covered . the little 
 village of UNK-127 was the UNK-370 of the ways . either they went to 
 the left towards the dublin mountains or along the UNK-516 road and 
 UNK-969 into UNK-449 coming home by UNK-285 . UNK-647 along the road 
 or standing in some UNK-578 UNK-688 public house his UNK-505 spoke 
 constantly of the subjects UNK-221 their hearts of irish politics of 
 UNK-994 and of the legends of their own family to all of which stephen 
 UNK-256 an UNK-503 ear . words which he did not understand he said over and 
 over to himself till he had UNK-294 them by heart and through them he 
 had UNK-329 of the real world about them . the hour when he too would 
 take part in the life of that world seemed drawing near and in secret 
 he began to make ready for the great part which he felt UNK-864 him the 
 nature of which he only UNK-815 UNK-943 . 
 UNK-0 
 his UNK-648 were his own and he UNK-162 over a UNK-884 translation of 
 the count of monte UNK-336 . the figure of that dark UNK-927 stood forth 
 in his mind for whatever he had heard or UNK-219 in childhood of the 
 strange and terrible . at night he built up on the UNK-309 table an 
 image of the wonderful island cave out of transfers and paper flowers 
 and UNK-332 tissue paper and strips of the silver and golden paper in 
 which chocolate is wrapped . when he had broken up this UNK-488 UNK-129 
 of its UNK-475 there would come to his mind the bright picture of 
 UNK-660 of sunny UNK-843 and of mercedes . 
 UNK-0 
 outside UNK-853 on the road that led to the mountains stood a small 
 UNK-586 house in the garden of which grew many UNK-471 and in 
 this house he told himself another mercedes lived . both on the 
 UNK-375 and on the UNK-94 journey he measured distance by this 
 UNK-159 and in his imagination he lived through a long train of 
 adventures UNK-902 as those in the book itself towards the close 
 of which there appeared an image of himself grown older and UNK-319 
 standing in a UNK-84 garden with mercedes who had so many years before 
 UNK-400 his love and with a UNK-542 proud UNK-359 of UNK-592 saying 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-280 i never eat UNK-9 UNK-712 . 
 UNK-0 
 he became the UNK-65 of a boy named UNK-825 mills and founded with him a 
 gang of UNK-460 in the avenue . UNK-825 carried a UNK-266 UNK-787 
 from his UNK-142 and a bicycle lamp attached to his belt while the 
 others had short sticks UNK-243 UNK-762 through UNK-75 . stephen who 
 had read of UNK-486 plain style of dress chose to remain UNK-0 
 and thereby UNK-736 for himself the pleasure of taking counsel with 
 his UNK-731 before giving orders . the gang made UNK-635 into the 
 gardens of old UNK-893 or went down to the castle and fought a battle on 
 the UNK-705 UNK-656 rocks coming home after it UNK-129 UNK-535 with 
 the UNK-377 UNK-940 of the UNK-408 in their UNK-304 and the rank oils 
 of the UNK-877 upon their hands and in their hair . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-825 and stephen had a common UNK-255 and often they drove out in the 
 UNK-449 to UNK-748 where the UNK-633 were at grass . while the men 
 were UNK-750 the boys would take turns in riding the UNK-782 UNK-488 
 round the field . but when autumn came the UNK-633 were driven home from 
 the grass and the first sight of the UNK-947 UNK-859 at UNK-466 with 
 its foul green UNK-633 and UNK-283 of liquid UNK-834 and UNK-467 UNK-520 
 UNK-214 UNK-64 UNK-8 heart . the cattle which had seemed so 
 beautiful in the country on sunny days UNK-128 him and he could not 
 even look at the milk they UNK-941 . 
 UNK-0 
 the coming of september did not trouble him this year for he was not to 
 be sent back to UNK-202 . the practice in the park came to an end when 
 mike UNK-86 went into hospital . UNK-825 was at school and had only an 
 hour or two free in the evening . the gang fell UNK-742 and there were 
 no more UNK-803 UNK-635 or UNK-602 on the rocks . stephen sometimes went 
 round with the car which delivered the evening milk and these UNK-618 
 drives UNK-299 away his memory of the UNK-374 of the UNK-859 and he felt no 
 UNK-283 at seeing the cow UNK-189 and UNK-938 on the UNK-791 coat . 
 whenever the car drew up before a house he UNK-56 to catch a UNK-332 of 
 a well UNK-164 kitchen or of a UNK-41 UNK-340 hall and to see how the 
 UNK-363 would hold the UNK-406 and how she would close the door . he thought 
 it should be a pleasant life enough driving along the roads every 
 evening to deliver milk if he had warm gloves and a fat bag of 
 UNK-281 in his pocket to eat from . but the same UNK-463 which 
 had UNK-64 his heart and made his legs UNK-58 suddenly as he UNK-671 round 
 the park the same UNK-73 which had made him glance with UNK-707 at 
 his trainers UNK-492 UNK-544 face as it bent heavily over his long 
 UNK-567 fingers UNK-56 any vision of the future . in a UNK-209 way he 
 understood that his father was in trouble and that this was the reason 
 why he himself had not been sent back to UNK-202 . for some time he 
 had felt the slight change in his house and those changes in what he 
 had deemed UNK-652 were so many slight UNK-585 to his UNK-848 
 UNK-991 of the world . the UNK-570 which he felt UNK-980 at times in 
 the darkness of his soul sought no outlet . a UNK-322 like that of the 
 outer world UNK-561 his mind as he heard the UNK-720 UNK-561 UNK-604 
 along the UNK-420 on the rock road and the great can UNK-223 and 
 UNK-437 behind him . 
 UNK-0 
 he returned to mercedes and as he UNK-444 upon her image a strange 
 UNK-927 UNK-270 into his blood . sometimes a fever gathered within him and 
 led him to UNK-423 alone in the evening along the quiet avenue . the peace 
 of the gardens and the UNK-320 lights in the windows UNK-207 a tender 
 influence into his UNK-741 heart . the noise of children at play 
 UNK-776 him and their silly voices made him feel even more UNK-345 than 
 he had felt at UNK-202 that he was different from others . he did not 
 want to play . he wanted to meet in the real world the UNK-495 
 image which his soul so constantly UNK-809 . he did not know where to 
 seek it or how but a UNK-946 which led him on told him that this 
 image would without any UNK-186 act of his encounter him . they would 
 meet UNK-40 as if they had known each other and had made their UNK-35 
 perhaps at one of the gates or in some more secret place . they would be 
 alone surrounded by darkness and silence and in that moment of 
 supreme UNK-145 he would be UNK-547 . 
 UNK-0 
 he would UNK-247 into something UNK-378 under her eyes and then in a 
 moment he would be UNK-547 . UNK-688 and UNK-777 and UNK-170 
 would fall from him in that magic moment .

 two great yellow UNK-686 had UNK-46 one morning before the door and 
 men had come UNK-132 into the house to UNK-220 it . the furniture had 
 been UNK-74 out through the front garden which was UNK-88 with UNK-454 
 of UNK-197 and rope ends and into the huge UNK-86 at the gate . when all had 
 been safely UNK-998 the UNK-86 had set off UNK-267 down the avenue and 
 from the window of the railway UNK-114 in which he had sat with his 
 UNK-82 mother stephen had seen them UNK-803 along the UNK-802 
 road . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-309 fire would not draw that evening and mr UNK-1 UNK-346 the 
 poker against the bars of the UNK-886 to attract the flame . uncle charles 
 UNK-415 in a corner of the half furnished UNK-448 room and near him 
 the family portraits UNK-122 against the wall . the lamp on the table 
 shed a weak light over the UNK-102 floor UNK-204 by the feet of the 
 UNK-24 . stephen sat on a UNK-111 beside his father listening to a 
 long and UNK-917 UNK-489 . he understood little or nothing of it at 
 first but he became slowly aware that his father had enemies and that 
 some fight was going to take place . he felt too that he was being 
 UNK-170 for the fight that some duty was being laid upon his 
 UNK-61 . the sudden flight from the comfort and UNK-562 of UNK-853 
 the passage through the UNK-484 UNK-792 city the thought of the bare 
 UNK-664 house in which they were now to live made his heart heavy 
 and again an UNK-73 a UNK-463 of the future came to him . he 
 understood also why the UNK-478 had often UNK-222 together in the 
 hall and why his father had often stood on the UNK-350 with his back 
 to the fire talking UNK-76 to uncle charles who UNK-318 him to sit down 
 and eat his dinner . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-6 a crack of the UNK-422 left in me yet stephen old UNK-26 said 
 mr UNK-1 UNK-688 at the UNK-66 fire with UNK-562 energy . were not dead 
 yet UNK-575 . no by the lord jesus god UNK-540 me not half dead . 
 UNK-0 
 dublin was a new and complex UNK-393 . uncle charles had grown so 
 UNK-459 that he could no longer be sent out on UNK-235 and the disorder 
 in UNK-571 in the new house left stephen UNK-149 than he had been in 
 UNK-853 . in the beginning he UNK-489 himself with UNK-748 UNK-686 
 round the UNK-467 square or at most going half way down one of 
 the side streets but when he had made a UNK-232 map of the city in his 
 mind he followed UNK-258 one of its central lines until he reached the 
 UNK-608 . he passed UNK-15 among the UNK-964 and along the UNK-719 
 wondering at the UNK-431 of UNK-684 that lay UNK-801 on the surface of 
 the water in a thick yellow UNK-974 at the UNK-291 of UNK-118 UNK-426 and the 
 UNK-994 UNK-328 and the UNK-892 UNK-663 UNK-869 . the UNK-12 and 
 UNK-449 of the life suggested to him by the UNK-988 of merchandise 
 UNK-493 along the walls or UNK-414 UNK-146 out of the holds of UNK-232 
 UNK-259 again in him the UNK-927 which had sent him UNK-254 in the 
 evening from garden to garden in search of mercedes . and UNK-22 this new 
 UNK-142 life he might have UNK-87 himself in another UNK-660 but that 
 he missed the bright sky and the UNK-981 UNK-843 of the UNK-681 . 
 a UNK-209 UNK-502 grew up within him as he looked on the UNK-719 and 
 on the river and on the UNK-314 UNK-106 and yet he continued to UNK-588 up 
 and down day after day as if he really sought someone that UNK-494 him . 
 UNK-0 
 he went once or twice with his mother to visit their relatives and 
 though they passed a UNK-32 array of shops lit up and UNK-463 for 
 christmas his mood of UNK-321 silence did not leave him . the causes 
 of his UNK-809 were many remote and near . he was angry with 
 himself for being young and the UNK-659 of UNK-741 UNK-735 UNK-100 
 angry also with the change of fortune which was UNK-722 the world 
 about him into a vision of UNK-499 and UNK-487 . yet his anger UNK-256 
 nothing to the vision . he UNK-585 with UNK-435 what he saw 
 UNK-945 himself from it and UNK-377 its UNK-569 UNK-201 in secret . 
 UNK-0 
 he was sitting on the UNK-451 chair in his UNK-37 kitchen . a lamp with 
 a UNK-792 hung on the UNK-147 wall of the fireplace and by its light 
 his UNK-7 was reading the evening paper that lay on her UNK-111 . she 
 looked a long time at a UNK-21 picture that was set in it and said 
 UNK-716 
 UNK-0 
 the beautiful UNK-80 hunter ! 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-756 girl stood on UNK-649 to peer at the picture and said UNK-41 
 UNK-0 
 what is she in mud ? 
 UNK-0 
 in a UNK-715 love . 
 UNK-0 
 the child UNK-122 her UNK-756 head against her mothers sleeve 
 UNK-248 on the picture and UNK-203 as if UNK-160 
 UNK-0 
 the beautiful UNK-80 hunter ! 
 UNK-0 
 as if UNK-160 her eyes UNK-346 long upon those UNK-464 UNK-436 
 eyes and she UNK-203 UNK-537 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-50 she an UNK-32 creature ? 
 UNK-0 
 and the boy who came in from the street UNK-349 UNK-907 under his 
 stone of coal heard her words . he dropped his load promptly on the 
 floor and UNK-569 to her side to see . he UNK-904 the edges of the paper 
 with his UNK-673 and UNK-73 hands UNK-212 her aside and 
 UNK-954 that he could not see . 
 UNK-0 
 he was sitting in the narrow breakfast room high up in the old 
 UNK-185 house . the UNK-777 UNK-254 on the wall and beyond the 
 window a UNK-642 UNK-322 was gathering upon the river . before the fire an 
 old woman was busy making tea and as she UNK-635 at the task she told 
 in a low voice of what the priest and the doctor had said . she told too 
 of certain changes they had seen in her of late and of her odd ways and 
 UNK-409 . he sat listening to the words and following the ways of 
 adventure that lay open in the UNK-918 UNK-535 and UNK-943 and UNK-407 
 galleries and UNK-440 UNK-378 . 
 UNK-0 
 suddenly he became aware of something in the UNK-102 . a UNK-241 appeared 
 suspended in the UNK-286 of the UNK-102 . a UNK-879 creature like a monkey 
 was there drawn UNK-467 by the sound of voices at the fire . a UNK-846 
 voice came from the door asking 
 UNK-0 
 is that UNK-405 ? 
 UNK-0 
 the old UNK-142 woman answered UNK-200 from the fireplace 
 UNK-0 
 no ellen its stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 o . . . o good evening stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 he answered the greeting and saw a silly smile break over the face in 
 the UNK-102 . 
 UNK-0 
 do you want anything ellen ? asked the old woman at the fire . 
 UNK-0 
 but she did not answer the question and said 
 UNK-0 
 i thought it was UNK-405 . i thought you were UNK-405 stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 and UNK-598 this several times she fell to laughing UNK-27 . 
 UNK-0 
 he was sitting in the UNK-619 of a childrens party at UNK-975 cross . 
 his silent UNK-559 manner had grown upon him and he took little part 
 in the games . the children wearing the UNK-66 of their UNK-854 
 UNK-452 and UNK-134 UNK-267 and though he tried to share their 
 UNK-95 he felt himself a UNK-484 figure UNK-22 the gay UNK-786 hats and 
 UNK-256 . 
 UNK-0 
 but when he had UNK-903 his song and UNK-275 into a UNK-817 corner of the 
 room he began to taste the joy of his UNK-964 . the UNK-899 which in 
 the beginning of the evening had seemed to him false and UNK-168 was 
 like a UNK-365 air to him passing UNK-219 by his UNK-344 UNK-8 from 
 other eyes the UNK-493 UNK-626 of his blood while through the 
 UNK-748 of the UNK-784 and UNK-22 the music and UNK-31 her glance 
 UNK-699 to his corner UNK-480 UNK-436 searching exciting his 
 heart . 
 UNK-0 
 in the hall the children who had stayed latest were putting on their 
 things the party was over . she had thrown a UNK-975 about her and as 
 they went together towards the UNK-80 UNK-578 of her fresh warm breath 
 UNK-230 UNK-219 above her UNK-401 head and her shoes UNK-408 UNK-529 on the 
 UNK-86 road . 
 UNK-0 
 it was the last UNK-80 . the UNK-987 brown horses knew it and UNK-35 their 
 UNK-215 to the clear night in UNK-291 . the UNK-654 talked with the 
 driver both UNK-278 often in the green light of the lamp . on the empty 
 seats of the UNK-80 were UNK-824 a few UNK-332 tickets . no sound of 
 UNK-981 came up or down the road . no sound broke the peace of the 
 night save when the UNK-987 brown horses UNK-866 their UNK-327 together and 
 UNK-35 their UNK-215 . 
 UNK-0 
 they seemed to listen he on the upper step and she on the lower . she 
 came up to his step many times and went down to UNK-349 again between 
 their phrases and once or twice stood close beside him for some moments 
 on the upper step UNK-779 to go down and then went down . his heart 
 UNK-452 upon her movements like a cork upon a tide . he heard what her 
 eyes said to him from beneath their UNK-392 and knew that in some dim 
 past whether in life or UNK-562 he had heard their tale before . he saw 
 her urge her UNK-136 her fine dress and UNK-914 and long black 
 stockings and knew that he had UNK-941 to them a thousand times . yet a 
 voice within him spoke above the noise of his dancing heart asking him 
 would he take her gift to which he had only to stretch out his hand . 
 and he remembered the day when he and UNK-174 had stood looking into the 
 hotel grounds watching the UNK-862 running up a trail of UNK-529 on 
 the UNK-576 and the fox UNK-617 UNK-243 to and UNK-161 on the sunny 
 lawn and how all of a sudden she had broken out into a UNK-909 of 
 UNK-31 and had run down the UNK-576 curve of the path . now as then 
 he stood UNK-34 in his place UNK-98 a UNK-263 UNK-398 of the 
 scene before him . 
 UNK-0 
 she too wants me to catch hold of her he thought . thats why she 
 came with me to the UNK-80 . i could easily catch hold of her when she 
 comes up to my step nobody is looking . i could hold her and kiss her . 
 UNK-0 
 but he did neither and when he was sitting alone in the UNK-761 
 UNK-80 he UNK-814 his ticket into UNK-565 and UNK-156 UNK-153 at the 
 UNK-802 UNK-915 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the next day he sat at his table in the bare upper room for many hours . 
 before him lay a new pen a new bottle of ink and a new emerald 
 exercise . from force of UNK-158 he had written at the top of the 
 first page the initial letters of the UNK-249 UNK-595 a UNK-462 UNK-465 UNK-771 . on the 
 first line of the page appeared the title of the UNK-351 he was trying 
 to write to e c . he knew it was right to begin so for he had seen 
 similar titles in the collected poems of lord UNK-172 . when he had 
 written this title and drawn an UNK-174 line UNK-733 he fell into 
 a UNK-850 and began to draw UNK-14 on the cover of the book . he saw 
 himself sitting at his table in UNK-841 the morning after the discussion 
 at the christmas dinner table trying to write a poem about UNK-121 on 
 the back of one of his fathers second UNK-218 notices . but his brain 
 had then refused to UNK-60 with the theme and UNK-188 he had 
 covered the page with the names and addresses of certain of his 
 UNK-192 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-99 UNK-833 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  john UNK-835 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  anthony UNK-402 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  simon UNK-729 
 UNK-0 
 now it seemed as if he would fail again but by UNK-813 of UNK-524 on the 
 incident he thought himself into confidence . during this process all 
 those elements which he deemed common and UNK-954 fell out of the 
 scene . there remained no trace of the UNK-80 itself nor of the UNK-315 
 nor of the horses nor did he and she appear UNK-818 . the UNK-351 told 
 only of the night and the UNK-946 UNK-226 and the maiden UNK-341 of the 
 moon . some undefined UNK-234 was hidden in the hearts of the 
 UNK-411 as they stood in silence beneath the UNK-815 trees and 
 when the moment of UNK-399 had come the kiss which had been UNK-454 
 by one was given by both . after this the letters l . d . s . were written 
 at the foot of the page and having hidden the book he went into his 
 mothers bedroom and UNK-84 at his face for a long time in the mirror of 
 her UNK-665 . 
 UNK-0 
 but his long spell of leisure and liberty was drawing to its end . one 
 evening his father came home full of news which kept his tongue busy 
 all through dinner . stephen had been UNK-540 his fathers return for 
 there had been UNK-811 hash that day and he knew that his father would 
 make him dip his bread in the UNK-609 . but he did not UNK-238 the hash for 
 the mention of UNK-202 had coated his UNK-201 with a UNK-974 of UNK-731 . 
 UNK-0 
 i walked bang into him said mr UNK-1 for the fourth time just at 
 the corner of the square . 
 UNK-0 
 then i suppose said mrs UNK-1 he will be able to arrange it . i 
 mean about UNK-928 . 
 UNK-0 
 of course he will said mr UNK-1 . dont i tell you UNK-2 provincial

 UNK-0

 UNK-3 and UNK-247 mud ? no let him stick to the UNK-517 in gods name

 UNK-0 
 rather . they live well i tell you . you saw their table at 
 UNK-202 . fed up by god like UNK-515 . 
 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-1 pushed his plate over to stephen and UNK-432 him finish what 
 was on it . 
 UNK-0 
 now then stephen he said you must put your shoulder to the wheel 
 old UNK-26 . UNK-628 had a fine long holiday . 
 UNK-0 
 o im sure hell work very hard now said mrs UNK-1 especially 
 when he has UNK-871 with him . 
 UNK-0 
 o holy paul i forgot about UNK-871 said mr UNK-1 . here

 UNK-19 that be grand fun ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-871 UNK-629 at his father and then at his brother . 
 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-1 UNK-960 his glass into his eye and UNK-156 hard at both his 
 sons . stephen UNK-799 his bread without answering his fathers UNK-49 . 
 UNK-0 
 by the bye said mr UNK-1 at length the UNK-96 or provincial 
 rather was telling me that story about you and father UNK-338 . UNK-14 an 
 UNK-763 UNK-547 he said . 
 UNK-0

 by the way who do you think he told me will get that job in the

 UNK-338 said i or young UNK-1 will send you up for twice nine . we had

 UNK-0

 for your life for UNK-38 ! 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 i told them all at dinner about it and father UNK-338 and i and all of 
 us we had a UNK-656 laugh together over it . ha ! ha ! ha !

 the night of the UNK-607 play had come and stephen from the window 
 of the UNK-902 looked out on the small UNK-771 across which 
 lines of chinese UNK-318 were UNK-269 . he watched the visitors come 
 down the steps from the house and pass into the theatre . UNK-323 in 
 evening dress old UNK-158 UNK-146 in groups about the entrance 
 to the theatre and UNK-399 in the visitors with ceremony . under the 
 sudden glow of a UNK-504 he could recognize the UNK-21 face of a 
 priest . 
 UNK-0 
 the blessed UNK-511 had been removed from the UNK-601 and the 
 first UNK-674 had been driven back so as to leave the UNK-798 of the UNK-92 
 and the space before it free . against the walls stood companies of 
 UNK-579 and indian clubs the UNK-746 were UNK-664 in one corner and 
 in the UNK-619 of UNK-910 UNK-345 of UNK-665 shoes and UNK-940 and 
 UNK-412 in UNK-824 brown UNK-879 there stood the UNK-98 UNK-252 
 UNK-920 horse waiting its turn to be carried up on the stage 
 and set in the middle of the winning team at the end of the UNK-89 
 display . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen though in UNK-269 to his reputation for essay writing he had 
 been elected secretary to the UNK-665 had had no part in the first 
 section of the programme but in the play which formed the second 
 section he had the chief part that of a UNK-581 UNK-789 . he had 
 been cast for it on account of his UNK-837 and grave UNK-347 for he was 
 now at the end of his second year at UNK-928 and in number two . 
 UNK-0 
 a score of the younger boys in white UNK-44 and UNK-412 came 
 UNK-908 down from the stage through the UNK-293 and to the chapel . 
 the UNK-293 and chapel were UNK-572 with UNK-44 masters and boys . the 
 UNK-191 bald UNK-616 major was testing with his foot the UNK-792 of 
 the UNK-920 horse . the lean young man in a long UNK-319 who was to 
 give a special display of UNK-49 club UNK-907 stood near watching 
 with interest his UNK-642 clubs UNK-991 out of his deep 
 UNK-781 . the hollow UNK-320 of the wooden UNK-746 was heard as 
 another team made ready to go up on the stage and in another moment the 
 excited UNK-89 was UNK-463 the boys through the UNK-293 like a UNK-275 of 
 UNK-793 UNK-438 the wings of his UNK-825 UNK-409 and UNK-273 to the 
 UNK-425 to make UNK-803 . a little UNK-480 of UNK-361 UNK-926 were 
 UNK-617 their steps at the end of the chapel some UNK-748 their arms 
 above their heads some UNK-223 their baskets of paper UNK-427 and 
 UNK-730 . in a dark corner of the chapel at the gospel side of the UNK-92 
 a UNK-98 old lady UNK-97 UNK-22 her UNK-436 black skirts . when she stood up a 
 UNK-602 figure wearing a UNK-693 golden UNK-726 and an UNK-853 UNK-197 
 UNK-857 with black UNK-827 UNK-993 and UNK-145 UNK-386 UNK-366 and 
 UNK-239 was discovered . a low UNK-208 of UNK-148 ran round the chapel 
 at the discovery of this UNK-175 figure . one of the UNK-881 UNK-21 and 
 UNK-278 his head UNK-596 the dark corner and having UNK-170 to the 
 UNK-98 old lady said UNK-477 
 UNK-0 
 is this a beautiful young lady or a doll that you have here mrs 
 UNK-287 ? 
 UNK-0 
 then UNK-277 down to peer at the UNK-21 painted face under the leaf 
 of the UNK-843 he UNK-751 
 UNK-0 
 no ! upon my word i believe its little UNK-44 UNK-287 after all ! 
 UNK-0 
 stephen at his post by the window heard the old lady and the priest 
 laugh together and heard the boys UNK-637 of UNK-870 behind him as 
 they passed forward to see the little boy who had to dance the 
 UNK-857 dance by himself . a movement of UNK-70 UNK-525 him . he 
 let the edge of the blind fall and UNK-764 down from the bench on 
 which he had been standing walked out of the chapel . 
 UNK-0 
 he passed out of the UNK-971 and UNK-46 under the shed that UNK-69 
 the garden . from the theatre opposite came the UNK-130 noise of the 
 audience and sudden UNK-271 UNK-692 of the soldiers band . the light 
 spread UNK-356 from the glass roof making the theatre seem a UNK-206 
 UNK-18 UNK-748 among the UNK-73 of houses her UNK-422 cables of UNK-318 
 UNK-157 her to her UNK-700 . a side door of the theatre opened suddenly 
 and a shaft of light UNK-230 across the grass plots . a sudden burst of 
 music issued from the UNK-18 the UNK-264 of a UNK-579 and when the side 
 door closed again the UNK-584 could hear the UNK-90 rhythm of the 
 music . the UNK-155 of the opening bars their UNK-389 and UNK-823 
 movement UNK-685 the UNK-49 UNK-370 which had been the cause of 
 all his days UNK-927 and of his UNK-114 movement of a moment before . 
 his UNK-927 issued from him like a wave of sound and on the tide of 
 UNK-441 music the UNK-18 was UNK-985 UNK-184 her cables of UNK-318 
 in her wake . then a noise like UNK-963 UNK-135 broke the movement . it 
 was the UNK-374 that UNK-593 the entry of the UNK-512 team on the 
 stage . 
 UNK-0 
 at the far end of the shed near the street a UNK-531 of pink light showed 
 in the darkness and as he walked towards it he became aware of a UNK-90 
 UNK-262 UNK-143 . two boys were standing in the shelter of a UNK-102 
 smoking and before he reached them he had recognised UNK-149 by his 
 voice . 
 UNK-0 
 here comes the noble UNK-1 ! UNK-5 a high UNK-577 voice . welcome to 
 our UNK-353 friend ! 
 UNK-0 
 this welcome ended in a soft UNK-909 of UNK-909 UNK-31 as UNK-149 
 UNK-278 and then began to UNK-597 the ground with his UNK-330 . 
 UNK-0 
 here i am said stephen UNK-370 and UNK-220 from UNK-149 to his 
 friend . 
 UNK-0 
 the latter was a stranger to him but in the darkness by the aid of the 
 UNK-808 cigarette tips he could make out a pale UNK-505 face over 
 which a smile was travelling slowly a tall UNK-397 figure and a 
 hard hat . UNK-149 did not trouble himself about an introduction but said 
 instead 
 UNK-0 
 i was just telling my friend UNK-658 what a UNK-248 it would be tonight 
 if you took off the UNK-96 in the part of the UNK-425 . it would be 
 a UNK-829 good joke . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-149 made a poor attempt to UNK-338 for his friend UNK-658 the UNK-176 
 UNK-842 bass and then laughing at his failure asked stephen to do 
 it . 
 UNK-0 
 go on UNK-1 he UNK-318 you can take him off UNK-592 . he that will 
 not hear the UNK-221 let him be to UNK-590 as the UNK-373 and the 
 UNK-32 . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-298 was UNK-128 by a mild expression of anger from UNK-658 
 in whose UNK-376 the cigarette had become too UNK-651 UNK-876 . 
 UNK-0 
 damn this UNK-841 blank holder he said taking it from his mouth 
 and UNK-21 and UNK-449 upon it UNK-553 . its always getting stuck 
 like that . do you use a holder ? 
 UNK-0 
 i dont smoke answered stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 no said UNK-149 UNK-1 is a model youth . he UNK-55 smoke and he 
 UNK-55 go to UNK-391 and he UNK-55 UNK-123 and he UNK-55 damn anything 
 or damn all . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-35 his head and UNK-24 in his UNK-244 UNK-327 and mobile 
 face UNK-908 like a birds . he had often thought it strange that 
 vincent UNK-149 had a birds face as well as a birds name . a shock of 
 pale hair lay on the UNK-133 like a UNK-635 crest the UNK-133 was 
 narrow and UNK-215 and a thin UNK-845 nose stood out between the UNK-379 
 prominent eyes which were light and UNK-986 . the UNK-244 were 
 school friends . they sat together in class UNK-97 together in the 
 chapel talked together after beads over their UNK-43 . as the UNK-13 
 in number one were UNK-616 UNK-598 stephen and UNK-149 had been 
 during the year the virtual heads of the school . it was they who went 
 up to the UNK-96 together to ask for a free day or to get a fellow off . 
 UNK-0 
 o by the way said UNK-149 suddenly i saw your governor going in . 
 UNK-0 
 the smile UNK-459 on UNK-8 face . any UNK-858 made to his father by a 
 fellow or by a master put his calm to UNK-883 in a moment . he UNK-56 in 
 UNK-901 silence to hear what UNK-149 might say next . UNK-149 however 
 UNK-377 him UNK-583 with his UNK-213 and said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-14 a UNK-147 dog . 
 UNK-0 
 why so ? said stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-306 think butter UNK-9 UNK-885 in your mouth said UNK-149 . but im 
 afraid UNK-14 a UNK-147 dog . 
 UNK-0 
 might i ask you what you are talking about ? said stephen UNK-755 . 
 UNK-0 
 indeed you might answered UNK-149 . we saw her UNK-658 UNK-3 we ? and 
 UNK-54 pretty she is too . and UNK-143 ! and what part does stephen 
 take mr UNK-1 ? and will stephen not sing mr UNK-1 ? your governor 
 was UNK-151 at her through that UNK-574 of his for all he was worth so 
 that i think the old man has found you out too . i UNK-9 care a bit 
 by UNK-414 . UNK-23 UNK-829 UNK-50 she UNK-658 ? 
 UNK-0 
 not half bad answered UNK-658 UNK-40 as he placed his holder once 
 more in a corner of his mouth . 
 UNK-0 
 a shaft of UNK-88 anger UNK-230 through UNK-8 mind at these 
 UNK-774 UNK-960 in the hearing of a stranger . for him there was 
 nothing UNK-893 in a girls interest and regard . all day he had thought 
 of nothing but their UNK-944 on the steps of the UNK-80 at UNK-975 
 cross the stream of UNK-712 emotions it had made to course through him 
 and the poem he had written about it . all day he had UNK-747 a new 
 meeting with her for he knew that she was to come to the play . the old 
 UNK-741 UNK-766 had again filled his breast as it had done on the 
 night of the party but had not found an outlet in verse . the growth 
 and knowledge of two years of UNK-492 stood between then and now 
 UNK-866 such an outlet and all day the stream of UNK-484 UNK-145 
 within him had started forth and returned upon itself in dark courses 
 and UNK-860 UNK-111 him in the end until the UNK-762 of the UNK-89 
 and the painted little boy had drawn from him a movement of UNK-70 . 
 UNK-0 
 so you may as well admit UNK-149 went on that UNK-623 fairly found you 
 out this time . you cant play the saint on me any more thats one sure 
 five . 
 UNK-0 
 a soft UNK-909 of UNK-909 UNK-31 UNK-525 from his lips and UNK-277 
 down as before he struck stephen UNK-79 across the UNK-992 of the leg 
 with his UNK-330 as if in UNK-730 UNK-0 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-8 moment of anger had already passed . he was neither UNK-160 
 nor confused but simply UNK-136 the UNK-388 to end . he UNK-253 UNK-77 
 what had seemed to him a silly UNK-839 for he knew that the 
 adventure in his mind stood in no danger from these words and his face 
 UNK-828 his UNK-244 false smile . 
 UNK-0 
 admit ! repeated UNK-149 striking him again with his UNK-330 across the 
 UNK-992 of the leg . 
 UNK-0 
 the stroke was UNK-389 but not so UNK-79 given as the first one had 
 been . stephen felt the skin UNK-270 and glow slightly and almost 
 UNK-169 and UNK-694 UNK-650 as if to meet his UNK-193 
 UNK-730 mood began to UNK-754 the UNK-775 . the episode ended well 
 for both UNK-149 and UNK-658 UNK-20 UNK-834 at the UNK-561 . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-343 came only from UNK-8 lips and while they spoke the 
 words a sudden memory had carried him to another scene called up as 
 if by magic at the moment when he had noted the UNK-90 UNK-165 UNK-806 at 
 the corners of UNK-315 UNK-21 lips and had felt the familiar stroke of 
 the UNK-330 against his UNK-992 and had heard the familiar word of 
 UNK-291 
 UNK-0 
 admit . 
 UNK-0 
 it was towards the close of his first term in the college when he was 
 in number six . his sensitive nature was still UNK-453 under the UNK-242 
 of an UNK-400 and UNK-707 way of life . his soul was still UNK-98 
 and cast down by the UNK-66 phenomenon of dublin . he had UNK-209 from a 
 two years spell of UNK-562 to find himself in the UNK-619 of a new scene 
 every event and figure of which affected him UNK-576 UNK-843 
 him or UNK-22 and whether UNK-364 or UNK-187 filled him 
 always with UNK-927 and UNK-412 thoughts . all the leisure which his 
 school life left him was passed in the company of UNK-677 writers 
 whose UNK-647 and violence of speech set up a UNK-778 in his brain before 
 they passed out of it into his crude writings . 
 UNK-0 
 the essay was for him the chief labour of his week and every tuesday 
 as he UNK-982 from home to the school he read his fate in the 
 incidents of the way UNK-735 himself against some figure ahead of him 
 and UNK-197 his pace to UNK-292 it before a certain goal was 
 reached or UNK-862 his steps UNK-19 in the spaces of the 
 UNK-324 of the UNK-987 and telling himself that he would be first and 
 not first in the weekly essay . 
 UNK-0 
 on a certain tuesday the course of his UNK-682 was UNK-394 broken . mr 
 UNK-808 the english master pointed his finger at him and said UNK-770 
 UNK-0 
 this fellow has UNK-351 in his essay . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-218 fell on the class . mr UNK-808 did not break it but UNK-951 with his 
 hand between his UNK-932 while his heavily UNK-283 UNK-683 UNK-296 about 
 his neck and UNK-982 . stephen did not look up . it was a raw spring 
 morning and his eyes were still UNK-453 and weak . he was conscious of 
 failure and of detection of the UNK-499 of his own mind and home and 
 felt against his neck the raw edge of his turned and UNK-440 collar . 
 UNK-0 
 a short loud laugh from mr UNK-808 set the class more at ease . 
 UNK-0 
 perhaps you UNK-3 know that he said . 
 UNK-0 
 where ? asked stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-808 UNK-740 his UNK-446 hand and spread out the essay . 
 UNK-0 
 here . its about the creator and the soul . UNK-468 . . . UNK-468 . . . UNK-468 . . . ah ! 
 without a possibility of ever UNK-781 UNK-221 . thats UNK-351 . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-203 
 UNK-0 
 i meant without a possibility of ever reaching . 
 UNK-0 
 it was a submission and mr UNK-808 UNK-709 UNK-177 up the essay and 
 passed it across to him saying 
 UNK-0 
 o . . UNK-547 ! ever reaching . thats another story . 
 UNK-0 
 but the class was not so soon UNK-709 . though nobody spoke to him of 
 the affair after class he could feel about him a UNK-209 general 
 UNK-755 joy . 
 UNK-0 
 a few nights after this public UNK-834 he was walking with a letter 
 along the UNK-146 road when he heard a voice cry 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-74 ! 
 UNK-0 
 he turned and saw three boys of his own class coming towards him in the 
 UNK-322 . it was UNK-149 who had called out and as he UNK-982 forward 
 between his two UNK-966 he UNK-841 the air before him with a thin 
 UNK-330 in time to their steps . UNK-937 his friend UNK-982 beside him a 
 large UNK-205 on his face while UNK-803 came on a few steps behind blowing 
 from the pace and UNK-658 his great red head . 
 UNK-0 
 as soon as the boys had turned into UNK-540 road together they began 
 to speak about books and writers saying what books they were reading 
 and how many books there were in their fathers UNK-793 at home . 
 stephen UNK-126 to them in some UNK-628 for UNK-937 was the UNK-89 
 and UNK-803 the UNK-657 of the class . in fact after some talk about their 
 favourite writers UNK-803 declared for captain UNK-400 who he said was 
 the greatest writer . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-231 ! said UNK-149 . ask UNK-1 . who is the greatest writer UNK-1 ? 
 UNK-0 
 stephen noted the UNK-756 in the question and said 
 UNK-0 
 of UNK-312 do you mean ? 
 UNK-0 
 yes . 
 UNK-0 
 newman i think . 
 UNK-0 
 is it UNK-788 newman ? asked UNK-937 . 
 UNK-0 
 yes answered stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-205 UNK-603 on UNK-267 UNK-977 face as he turned to stephen and 
 said 
 UNK-0 
 and do you like UNK-788 newman UNK-1 ? 
 UNK-0 
 o many say that newman has the best UNK-312 style UNK-149 said to the 
 other two in explanation of course UNK-2 not a poet . 
 UNK-0 
 and who is the best poet UNK-149 ? asked UNK-937 . 
 UNK-0 
 lord UNK-717 of course answered UNK-149 . 
 UNK-0 
 o yes lord UNK-717 said UNK-803 . we have all his poetry at home in a 
 book . 
 UNK-0 
 at this stephen forgot the silent UNK-805 he had been making and burst out 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-717 a poet ! why UNK-2 only a UNK-78 ! 
 UNK-0 
 o get out ! said UNK-149 . everyone knows that UNK-717 is the greatest 
 poet . 
 UNK-0 
 and who do you think is the greatest poet ? asked UNK-937 UNK-115 his 
 UNK-379 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-172 of course answered stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-149 gave the lead and all three joined in a UNK-507 laugh . 
 UNK-0 
 what are you laughing at ? asked stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 you said UNK-149 . UNK-172 the greatest poet ! UNK-2 only a poet for 
 UNK-231 people . 
 UNK-0 
 he must be a fine poet ! said UNK-937 . 
 UNK-0 
 you may keep your mouth shut said stephen turning on him UNK-258 . 
 all you know about poetry is what you wrote up on the UNK-912 in the 
 yard and were going to be sent to the UNK-203 for . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-937 in fact was said to have written on the UNK-912 in the yard a 
 UNK-754 about a UNK-5 of his who often UNK-622 home from the college 
 on a UNK-923 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  as UNK-4 was riding into jerusalem 
 UNK-0  he fell and hurt his UNK-193 UNK-585 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 this UNK-243 put the two UNK-506 to silence but UNK-149 went on 
 UNK-0 
 in any case UNK-172 was a UNK-637 and UNK-624 too . 
 UNK-0 
 i dont care what he was UNK-5 stephen UNK-25 . 
 UNK-0 
 you dont care whether he was a UNK-637 or not ? said UNK-803 . 
 UNK-0 
 what do you know about it ? UNK-247 stephen . you never read a line of 
 anything in your life except a trans or UNK-937 either . 
 UNK-0 
 i know that UNK-172 was a bad man said UNK-937 . 
 UNK-0 
 here catch hold of this UNK-637 UNK-149 called out . in a moment 
 stephen was a prisoner . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-808 made you buck up the other day UNK-149 went on about the UNK-351 
 in your essay . 
 UNK-0 
 ill tell him tomorrow said UNK-937 . 
 UNK-0 
 will you ? said stephen . UNK-306 be afraid to open your lips . 
 UNK-0 
 afraid ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-42 . afraid of your life . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-934 yourself ! UNK-5 UNK-149 cutting at UNK-8 legs with his 
 UNK-330 . 
 UNK-0 
 it was the signal for their UNK-653 . UNK-803 UNK-489 his arms behind while 
 UNK-937 UNK-457 a long UNK-388 UNK-645 which was lying in the UNK-701 . 
 UNK-875 and UNK-325 under the cuts of the UNK-330 and the UNK-277 of the 
 UNK-635 UNK-645 stephen was UNK-618 back against a UNK-823 wire fence . 
 UNK-0 
 admit that UNK-172 was no good . 
 UNK-0 
 no . 
 UNK-0 
 admit . 
 UNK-0 
 no . 
 UNK-0 
 admit . 
 UNK-0 
 no . no . 
 UNK-0 
 at last after a UNK-558 of UNK-819 he UNK-876 himself free . his 
 UNK-528 set off towards UNK-41 road laughing and UNK-372 at him 
 while he half UNK-911 with tears UNK-886 on UNK-316 his UNK-177 
 UNK-878 and UNK-260 . 
 UNK-0 
 while he was still UNK-598 the UNK-775 UNK-22 the UNK-366 UNK-31 
 of his UNK-614 and while the scenes of that UNK-755 episode were 
 still passing UNK-278 and UNK-171 before his mind he UNK-105 why he 
 UNK-135 no UNK-953 now to those who had UNK-77 him . he had not forgotten 
 a UNK-541 of their UNK-108 and UNK-320 but the memory of it called forth 
 no anger from him . all the descriptions of UNK-562 love and UNK-985 which 
 he had met in books had seemed to him therefore UNK-650 . even that night 
 as he UNK-886 UNK-946 along UNK-41 road he had felt that some power 
 was UNK-157 him of that UNK-764 anger as easily as a fruit is 
 UNK-423 of its soft ripe UNK-215 . 
 UNK-0 
 he remained standing with his two UNK-193 at the end of the shed 
 listening UNK-864 to their talk or to the UNK-836 of UNK-541 in the 
 theatre . she was sitting there among the others perhaps waiting for him 
 to appear . he tried to recall her appearance but could not . he could 
 remember only that she had worn a UNK-975 about her head like a UNK-392 and 
 that her dark eyes had invited and UNK-180 him . he UNK-105 had he 
 been in her thoughts as she had been in his . then in the dark and 
 UNK-768 by the other two he UNK-346 the tips of the fingers of one hand 
 upon the palm of the other hand UNK-253 UNK-358 it UNK-79 . but the 
 pressure of her fingers had been lighter and UNK-418 and suddenly the 
 memory of their touch UNK-319 his brain and body like an invisible 
 wave . 
 UNK-0 
 a boy came towards them running along under the shed . he was excited 
 and UNK-21 . 
 UNK-0 
 o UNK-1 he UNK-5 UNK-733 is in a great UNK-643 about you . UNK-14 to 
 go in at once and get dressed for the play . UNK-282 up you better . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-2 coming now said UNK-149 to the messenger with a UNK-706 UNK-435 
 when he wants to . 
 UNK-0 
 the boy turned to UNK-149 and repeated 
 UNK-0 
 but UNK-733 is in an awful UNK-643 . 
 UNK-0 
 will you tell UNK-733 with my best UNK-857 that i UNK-100 his eyes ? 
 answered UNK-149 . 
 UNK-0 
 well i must go now said stephen who UNK-394 little for such points 
 of UNK-88 . 
 UNK-0 
 i UNK-9 said UNK-149 damn me if i would . thats no way to send 
 for one of the senior boys . in a UNK-643 indeed ! i think its quite 
 enough that UNK-14 taking a part in his UNK-485 old play . 
 UNK-0 
 this spirit of UNK-247 UNK-265 which he had observed lately in 
 his UNK-907 had not UNK-886 stephen from his habits of quiet UNK-268 . 
 he UNK-508 the UNK-568 and UNK-37 the UNK-904 of such 
 UNK-265 which seemed to him a sorry UNK-591 of UNK-135 . the 
 question of UNK-88 here raised was like all such questions UNK-168 to 
 him . while his mind had been UNK-360 its UNK-737 UNK-683 and 
 turning in UNK-677 from such pursuit he had heard about him the 
 constant voices of his father and of his masters UNK-293 him to be a 
 gentleman above all things and UNK-293 him to be a good catholic above all 
 things . these voices had now come to be UNK-354 in his ears . when 
 the UNK-665 had been opened he had heard another voice UNK-293 him to be 
 strong and UNK-306 and healthy and when the movement towards national 
 UNK-35 had begun to be felt in the college yet another voice had UNK-334 
 him be true to his country and help to raise up her language and 
 tradition . in the UNK-824 world as he UNK-265 a UNK-6 voice would bid 
 him raise up his fathers fallen state by his UNK-32 and meanwhile the 
 voice of his school UNK-761 UNK-318 him to be a decent fellow to shield 
 others from blame or to UNK-429 them off and to do his best to get free days 
 for the school . and it was the UNK-595 of all these UNK-354 voices 
 that made him UNK-74 UNK-997 in the pursuit of UNK-683 . he gave them 
 ear only for a time but he was happy only when he was far from them 
 beyond their call alone or in the company of UNK-617 UNK-761 . 
 UNK-0 
 in the UNK-293 a UNK-191 UNK-992 UNK-249 and an elderly man in UNK-152 
 blue clothes were UNK-17 in a case of UNK-546 and UNK-720 . the boys 
 who had been painted walked about or stood still UNK-583 UNK-358 
 their faces in a UNK-426 fashion with their UNK-238 UNK-455 . in the 
 middle of the UNK-293 a young UNK-249 who was then on a visit to the 
 college stood UNK-147 himself UNK-996 from the tips of his UNK-297 
 to his UNK-183 and back again his hands UNK-243 well forward into his 
 UNK-781 . his small head set off with UNK-419 red UNK-398 and his 
 newly UNK-679 face agreed well with the UNK-673 UNK-224 of his UNK-825 
 and with his UNK-673 shoes . 
 UNK-0 
 as he watched this UNK-223 form and tried to read for himself the 
 legend of the UNK-73 UNK-55 smile there came into UNK-8 memory a 
 saying which he had heard from his father before he had been sent to 
 UNK-202 that you could always tell a UNK-249 by the style of his 
 clothes . at the same moment he thought he saw a UNK-282 between his 
 fathers mind and that of this UNK-21 UNK-284 priest and he was 
 aware of some UNK-168 of the UNK-73 office or of the UNK-293 
 itself whose silence was now UNK-605 by loud talk and UNK-434 and its air 
 UNK-162 with the UNK-908 of the UNK-923 and the UNK-985 . 
 UNK-0 
 while his UNK-133 was being UNK-623 and his UNK-968 painted black and 
 blue by the elderly man he UNK-126 UNK-479 to the voice of the 
 UNK-191 young UNK-249 which UNK-432 him speak up and make his points clearly . 
 he could hear the band playing the UNK-246 of UNK-273 and knew that in a 
 few moments the UNK-622 would go up . he felt no stage UNK-512 but the 
 thought of the part he had to play UNK-8 him . a UNK-168 of 
 some of his lines made a sudden flush rise to his painted UNK-145 . he 
 saw her serious UNK-364 eyes watching him from among the audience and 
 their image at once UNK-716 away his UNK-95 leaving his will compact . 
 another nature seemed to have been UNK-256 him the infection of the 
 excitement and youth about him entered into and UNK-95 his UNK-712 
 UNK-498 . for one rare moment he seemed to be UNK-389 in the 
 real apparel of UNK-492 and as he stood in the wings among the other 
 players he shared the common UNK-899 UNK-22 which the drop scene was 
 UNK-866 UNK-356 by two UNK-747 UNK-73 with violent UNK-708 and all UNK-764 . 
 UNK-0 
 a few moments after he found himself on the stage UNK-22 the UNK-207 gas 
 and the dim UNK-488 acting before the UNK-304 faces of the void . 
 it surprised him to see that the play which he had known at UNK-928 
 for a UNK-558 UNK-540 thing had suddenly assumed a life of its own . 
 it seemed now to play itself he and his fellow actors UNK-443 it with 
 their parts . when the UNK-622 fell on the last scene he heard the void 
 filled with UNK-541 and through a UNK-364 in a side scene saw the 
 simple body before which he had UNK-145 UNK-430 UNK-109 the void of 
 faces breaking at all points and falling UNK-742 into busy groups . 
 UNK-0 
 he left the stage quickly and rid himself of his UNK-280 and passed out 
 through the chapel into the college garden . now that the play was over 
 his UNK-510 UNK-5 for some further adventure . he UNK-569 UNK-292 as if 
 to UNK-888 it . the doors of the theatre were all open and the audience 
 had UNK-198 out . on the lines which he had UNK-87 the UNK-700 of an 
 UNK-18 a few UNK-318 UNK-414 in the night UNK-226 UNK-225 UNK-546 . 
 he mounted the steps from the garden in UNK-803 UNK-44 that some UNK-659 
 should not UNK-156 him and forced his way through the crowd in the hall 
 and past the two UNK-517 who stood watching the UNK-357 and UNK-694 and 
 UNK-144 hands with the visitors . he pushed UNK-90 UNK-409 UNK-945 a 
 still greater UNK-803 and UNK-284 conscious of the UNK-479 and UNK-926 and 
 UNK-594 which his UNK-239 head left in its wake . 
 UNK-0 
 when he came out on the steps he saw his family waiting for him at the 
 first lamp . in a glance he noted that every figure of the group was 
 familiar and ran down the steps UNK-551 . 
 UNK-0 
 i have to leave a message down in UNK-528 street he said to his 
 father quickly . ill be home after you . 
 UNK-0 
 without waiting for his fathers questions he ran across the road and 
 began to walk at UNK-551 speed down the hill . he hardly knew where he 
 was walking . pride and hope and desire like UNK-880 herbs in his heart 
 sent up UNK-171 of UNK-92 UNK-402 before the eyes of his mind . he 
 UNK-536 down the hill UNK-22 the UNK-906 of UNK-319 UNK-171 of UNK-110 
 pride and fallen hope and UNK-25 desire . they UNK-984 UNK-356 before 
 his UNK-275 eyes in dense and UNK-92 UNK-96 and passed away above 
 him till at last the air was clear and cold again . 
 UNK-0 
 a film still UNK-585 his eyes but they UNK-416 no longer . a power UNK-278 
 to that which had often made anger or UNK-617 fall from him brought 
 his steps to rest . he stood still and UNK-84 up at the UNK-967 UNK-372 of 
 the UNK-361 and from that to the dark UNK-218 UNK-833 at its side . he 
 saw the word UNK-841 on the wall of the lane and UNK-98 slowly the rank 
 heavy air . 
 UNK-0 
 that is horse piss and UNK-463 UNK-197 he thought . it is a good UNK-143 to 
 UNK-820 . it will calm my heart . my heart is quite calm now . i will go 
 back .

 stephen was once again UNK-154 beside his father in the corner of a 
 railway UNK-114 at UNK-58 . he was travelling with his father by 
 the night mail to cork . as the train UNK-858 out of the station he 
 UNK-225 his UNK-191 wonder of years before and every event of his 
 first day at UNK-202 . but he felt no wonder now . he saw the UNK-3 
 lands UNK-851 away past him the silent UNK-157 passing his 
 window UNK-171 every four seconds the little UNK-137 stations 
 UNK-651 by a few silent UNK-922 UNK-168 by the mail behind her and 
 UNK-564 for a moment in the darkness like UNK-163 UNK-947 UNK-168 
 UNK-940 by a runner . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-126 without sympathy to his fathers UNK-392 of cork and of 
 scenes of his youth a tale broken by UNK-281 or UNK-599 from his pocket 
 UNK-30 whenever the image of some dead friend appeared in it or whenever 
 the UNK-446 remembered suddenly the purpose of his actual visit . stephen 
 heard but could feel no UNK-47 . the images of the dead were all UNK-76 
 to him save that of uncle charles an image which had lately been 
 UNK-546 out of memory . he knew however that his fathers property was 
 going to be sold by auction and in the manner of his own UNK-186 
 he felt the world give the lie UNK-394 to his UNK-63 . 
 UNK-0 
 at UNK-357 he fell UNK-314 . when he UNK-170 the train had passed out 
 of UNK-371 and his father was UNK-269 UNK-314 on the other seat . the 
 cold light of the dawn lay over the country over the UNK-644 fields 
 and the closed cottages . the terror of sleep UNK-160 his mind as he 
 watched the silent country or heard from time to time his fathers deep 
 breath or sudden UNK-638 movement . the UNK-501 of UNK-768 UNK-523 
 filled him with strange UNK-230 as though they could harm him and he 
 UNK-124 that the day might come quickly . his prayer addressed neither 
 to god nor saint began with a UNK-485 as the UNK-618 morning UNK-226 
 UNK-270 through the UNK-584 of the UNK-114 door to his feet and ended in 
 a trail of UNK-735 words which he made to fit the UNK-74 rhythm of 
 the train and UNK-173 at intervals of four seconds the 
 UNK-157 held the UNK-608 notes of the music between UNK-917 
 bars . this UNK-942 music UNK-567 his UNK-230 and UNK-200 against the 
 UNK-806 he let his UNK-863 close again . 
 UNK-0 
 they drove in a UNK-298 across cork while it was still early morning and 
 stephen finished his sleep in a bedroom of the victoria hotel . the 
 bright warm UNK-252 was streaming through the window and he could hear 
 the UNK-595 of traffic . his father was standing before the UNK-665 
 examining his hair and face and UNK-91 with great care UNK-819 his 
 neck across the UNK-489 and drawing it back UNK-174 to see the better . 
 while he did so he UNK-57 UNK-41 to himself with UNK-495 accent and UNK-767 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-446 youth and UNK-813 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  makes young men UNK-454 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  so here my love ill 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  no longer stay . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  what cant be UNK-514 sure 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  must be injured sure 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  so ill go to 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-64 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  my love UNK-23 UNK-218 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  my love UNK-23 UNK-215 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-23 like good UNK-224 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  when it is new 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  but when UNK-446 old 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  and growing cold 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  it UNK-489 and dies like 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  the mountain UNK-826 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 the consciousness of the warm sunny city outside his window and the 
 tender UNK-317 with which his fathers voice UNK-149 the strange sad 
 happy air drove off all the UNK-683 of the nights ill UNK-179 from 
 UNK-8 brain . he got up quickly to dress and when the song had 
 ended said 
 UNK-0 
 thats much UNK-569 than any of your other UNK-846 . 
 UNK-0 
 do you think so ? asked mr UNK-1 . 
 UNK-0 
 i like it said stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 its a pretty old air said mr UNK-1 UNK-15 the points of his 
 UNK-91 . ah but you should have heard UNK-151 UNK-501 sing it ! poor UNK-151 
 UNK-501 ! he had little turns for it grace notes that he used to put in 
 that i UNK-204 got . that was the boy who could sing a UNK-224 if 
 you like . 
 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-1 had ordered UNK-723 for breakfast and during the meal he 
 UNK-248 the UNK-738 for local news . for the most part they spoke 
 at cross purposes when a name was mentioned the UNK-738 having in mind 
 the present holder and mr UNK-1 his father or perhaps his 
 UNK-423 . 
 UNK-0 
 well i hope they UNK-204 moved the queens college UNK-58 said mr 
 UNK-1 for i want to show it to this UNK-13 of mine . 
 UNK-0 
 along the UNK-712 the trees were in bloom . they entered the grounds of 
 the college and were led by the UNK-254 porter across the UNK-955 . 
 but their progress across the UNK-59 was brought to a UNK-74 after every 
 dozen or so UNK-474 by some reply of the UNK-426 . 
 UNK-0 
 ah do you tell me so ? and is poor UNK-834 dead ? 
 UNK-0 
 yes sir . dead sir . 
 UNK-0 
 during these UNK-152 stephen stood UNK-583 behind the two men UNK-129 of 
 the subject and waiting UNK-272 for the slow march to begin again . 
 by the time they had UNK-112 the UNK-955 his UNK-778 had UNK-482 
 to fever . he UNK-105 how his father whom he knew for a UNK-295 
 UNK-576 man could be UNK-400 by the UNK-40 UNK-347 of the porter 
 and the UNK-334 southern speech which had UNK-940 him all the 
 morning now UNK-120 his ears . 
 UNK-0 
 they passed into the anatomy theatre where mr UNK-1 the porter 
 UNK-443 him searched the UNK-592 for his UNK-642 . stephen remained in 
 the background UNK-762 more than ever by the darkness and silence of 
 the theatre and by the air it UNK-71 of UNK-901 and formal study . on the 
 desk he read the word UNK-615 cut several times in the dark UNK-567 
 wood . the sudden legend UNK-66 his blood he seemed to feel the 
 absent students of the college about him and to UNK-943 from their 
 company . a vision of their life which his fathers words had been 
 UNK-262 to UNK-632 UNK-418 up before him out of the word cut in the 
 desk . a UNK-5 student with a UNK-91 was cutting in the 
 letters with a UNK-540 seriously . other students stood or sat near 
 him laughing at his UNK-522 . one UNK-448 his UNK-213 . the big student 
 turned on him UNK-449 . he was dressed in loose grey clothes and had 
 tan boots . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-8 name was called . he UNK-569 down the steps of the theatre so 
 as to be as far away from the vision as he could be and UNK-639 
 closely at his fathers UNK-642 UNK-373 his UNK-327 face . 
 UNK-0 
 but the word and the vision UNK-103 before his eyes as he walked back 
 across the UNK-955 and towards the college gate . it UNK-312 him to 
 find in the outer world a trace of what he had deemed till then a 
 UNK-545 and individual UNK-726 of his own mind . his UNK-395 UNK-701 
 came UNK-530 into his memory . they too had UNK-103 up before him 
 suddenly and UNK-869 out of mere words . he had soon given in to them 
 and allowed them to UNK-407 across and UNK-604 his UNK-678 wondering 
 always where they came from from what den of UNK-395 images and 
 always weak and UNK-369 towards others UNK-741 and UNK-64 of himself 
 when they had UNK-716 over him . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-42 UNK-79 ! and UNK-6 the UNK-242 sure enough ! UNK-5 mr UNK-1 . 
 you often heard me speak of the UNK-242 UNK-3 you stephen . UNK-10 
 the time we went down there when our names had been marked a crowd of 
 us harry UNK-712 and little jack mountain and bob UNK-470 and UNK-871 
 UNK-394 the UNK-797 and tom UNK-734 and UNK-151 UNK-501 that i told you 
 of this morning and UNK-977 UNK-197 and poor little UNK-921 johnny 
 UNK-881 of the UNK-326 . 
 UNK-0 
 the leaves of the trees along the UNK-712 were UNK-980 and UNK-387 in 
 the UNK-252 . a team of UNK-421 passed UNK-386 young men in UNK-781 
 and UNK-817 one of them carrying the long green UNK-834 . in a quiet 
 UNK-422 a german band of five players in UNK-238 UNK-591 and with 
 UNK-36 brass instruments was playing to an audience of street UNK-366 
 and UNK-855 messenger boys . a UNK-685 in a white cap and UNK-99 was 
 UNK-280 a box of plants on a UNK-654 which UNK-493 like a UNK-758 of UNK-740 
 in the warm UNK-966 . from another window open to the air came the sound 
 of a piano scale after scale rising into the UNK-400 . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen walked on at his fathers side listening to stories he had 
 heard before hearing again the names of the UNK-824 and dead 
 UNK-876 who had been the UNK-193 of his fathers youth . and a 
 UNK-90 UNK-309 UNK-279 in his heart . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-225 his own UNK-603 position in UNK-928 a free boy a 
 leader afraid of his own authority proud and sensitive and UNK-576 
 UNK-688 against the UNK-499 of his life and against the UNK-306 of his 
 mind . the letters cut in the UNK-567 wood of the desk UNK-156 upon him 
 UNK-55 his UNK-919 UNK-688 and UNK-931 UNK-553 and making him 
 UNK-582 himself for his own mad and UNK-947 UNK-889 . the UNK-976 in his 
 throat grew UNK-412 and foul to UNK-741 and the UNK-90 UNK-309 UNK-350 
 to his brain so that for a moment he closed his eyes and walked on in 
 darkness . 
 UNK-0 
 he could still hear his fathers voice 
 UNK-0 
 when you kick out for yourself UNK-928 i UNK-48 you will one 
 of these UNK-198 whatever you do to mix with UNK-32 . when 
 i was a young fellow i tell you i enjoyed myself . i mixed with fine 
 decent UNK-13 . everyone of us could do something . one fellow had a 
 good voice another fellow was a good actor another could sing a good 
 comic song another was a good UNK-468 or a good UNK-209 player another 
 could tell a good story and so on . we kept the ball rolling UNK-58 and 
 enjoyed ourselves and saw a bit of life and we were none the worse of 
 it either . but we were all UNK-32 UNK-931 least i hope we UNK-18 
 bloody good honest UNK-515 too . thats the kind of UNK-13 i want 
 you to associate with UNK-13 of the right kidney . im talking to 
 you as a friend stephen . i dont believe a son should be afraid of his 
 father . no i treat you as your UNK-423 treated me when i was a 
 young UNK-26 . we were more like brothers than father and son . ill never 
 forget the first day he caught me smoking . i was standing at the end of 
 the south terrace one day with some UNK-963 like myself and sure we 
 thought we were grand UNK-13 because we had pipes stuck in the corners 
 of our UNK-682 . suddenly the governor passed . he UNK-3 say a word or 
 stop even . but the next day sunday we were out for a walk together 
 and when we were coming home he took out his UNK-455 case and UNK-500 
 the by simon i UNK-3 know you UNK-146 or something like that UNK-986 
 course i tried to carry it off as best i could UNK-132 you want a good 
 smoke he said try one of these UNK-765 . an american captain made me a 
 present of them last night in UNK-74 . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen heard his fathers voice break into a laugh which was almost a 
 UNK-278 . 
 UNK-0 
 he was the UNK-815 man in cork at that time by god he was ! the 
 women used to stand to look after him in the street . 
 UNK-0 
 he heard the UNK-278 passing UNK-76 down his fathers throat and opened his 
 eyes with a nervous UNK-231 . the UNK-252 breaking suddenly on his 
 sight turned the sky and clouds into a fantastic world of UNK-967 UNK-152 
 with UNK-866 spaces of dark UNK-716 light . his very brain was sick and 
 UNK-262 . he could UNK-253 UNK-990 the letters of the UNK-987 of 
 the shops . by his UNK-395 way of life he seemed to have put himself 
 beyond the limits of reality . nothing moved him or spoke to him from 
 the real world unless he heard in it an echo of the UNK-943 UNK-155 
 within him . he could respond to no UNK-392 or human appeal dumb and 
 UNK-685 to the call of summer and UNK-158 and UNK-678 
 UNK-458 and UNK-215 by his fathers voice . he could UNK-253 recognize 
 as his own thoughts and repeated slowly to himself 
 UNK-0 
 i am stephen UNK-1 . i am walking beside my father whose name is 
 simon UNK-1 . we are in cork in ireland . cork is a city . our room is 
 in the victoria hotel . victoria and stephen and simon . simon and 
 stephen and victoria . names . 
 UNK-0 
 the memory of his childhood suddenly grew dim . he tried to call forth 
 some of its UNK-606 moments but could not . he UNK-225 only names . UNK-68 
 UNK-121 UNK-166 UNK-202 . a little boy had been taught geography by an 
 old woman who kept two UNK-842 in her UNK-116 . then he had been sent 
 away from home to a college he had made his first UNK-415 and UNK-361 
 slim jim out of his cricket cap and watched the UNK-777 UNK-410 and 
 dancing on the wall of a little bedroom in the UNK-129 and UNK-181 of 
 being dead of mass being said for him by the UNK-96 in a black and 
 gold cope of being buried then in the little UNK-963 of the 
 community off the main avenue of UNK-673 . but he had not died then . 
 UNK-121 had died . there had been no mass for the dead in the chapel and 
 no UNK-643 . he had not died but he had UNK-238 out like a film in the 
 sun . he had been lost or had UNK-326 out of existence for he no longer 
 existed . how strange to think of him passing out of existence in such a 
 way not by death but by UNK-546 out in the sun or by being lost and 
 forgotten somewhere in the universe ! it was strange to see his small 
 body appear again for a moment a little boy in a grey UNK-748 suit . his 
 hands were in his UNK-781 and his UNK-48 were UNK-852 in at the 
 UNK-111 by UNK-582 bands . 
 UNK-0 
 on the evening of the day on which the property was sold stephen 
 followed his father UNK-428 about the city from bar to bar . to the 
 sellers in the market to the UNK-225 and UNK-333 to the UNK-228 who 
 UNK-272 him for a UNK-771 mr UNK-1 told the same UNK-666 he was an 
 old UNK-414 that he had been trying for thirty years to get rid of 
 his cork accent up in dublin and that peter UNK-187 beside him was 
 his UNK-904 son but that he was only a dublin UNK-495 . 
 UNK-0 
 they had set out early in the morning from UNK-772 UNK-585 
 where mr UNK-664 cup had UNK-590 UNK-267 against its UNK-103 and 
 stephen had tried to cover that UNK-402 sign of his fathers drinking 
 UNK-177 of the night before by moving his chair and UNK-14 . one 
 UNK-396 had UNK-427 UNK-242 false UNK-479 of the market 
 sellers the UNK-488 and UNK-918 of the UNK-333 with whom his 
 father UNK-679 the UNK-857 and encouraging words of his fathers 
 friends . they had told him that he had a great look of his UNK-423 
 and mr UNK-1 had agreed that he was an ugly UNK-282 . they had 
 UNK-266 UNK-111 of a cork accent in his speech and made him admit that 
 the lee was a much UNK-894 river than the UNK-564 . one of them in order 
 to put his latin to the proof had made him translate short UNK-409 
 from UNK-674 and asked him whether it was correct to say UNK-183 
 UNK-29 UNK-209 et UNK-659 in UNK-45 or UNK-183 UNK-29 et UNK-209 UNK-659 in 
 UNK-45 . another a UNK-517 old man whom mr UNK-1 called johnny UNK-207 
 had covered him with confusion by asking him to say which were 
 UNK-569 the dublin girls or the cork girls . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-2 not that way built said mr UNK-1 . leave him alone . UNK-2 a 
 UNK-244 thinking boy who UNK-55 bother his head about that kind 
 of UNK-221 . 
 UNK-0 
 then UNK-2 not his fathers son said the little old man . 
 UNK-0 
 i dont know im sure said mr UNK-1 UNK-21 UNK-506 . 
 UNK-0 
 your father said the little old man to stephen was the UNK-981 UNK-123 
 in the city of cork in his day . do you know that ? 
 UNK-0 
 stephen looked down and studied the UNK-241 floor of the bar into which 
 they had UNK-31 . 
 UNK-0 
 now dont be putting ideas into his head said mr UNK-1 . leave him 
 to his maker . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-725 sure i UNK-9 put any ideas into his head . im old enough 
 to be his UNK-423 . and i am a UNK-423 said the little old man 
 to stephen . do you know that ? 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0 
 stephen watched the three glasses being raised from the counter as his 
 father and his two UNK-894 UNK-59 to the memory of their past . an UNK-533 
 of fortune or of UNK-910 UNK-729 him from them . his mind seemed 
 older than UNK-75 it UNK-493 UNK-482 on their UNK-706 and happiness and 
 UNK-147 like a moon upon a younger earth . no life or youth UNK-937 in 
 him as it had UNK-937 in them . he had known neither the pleasure of 
 UNK-678 with others nor the UNK-502 of UNK-292 male health nor UNK-27 
 UNK-101 . nothing UNK-937 within his soul but a cold and UNK-165 and 
 UNK-941 UNK-431 . his childhood was dead or lost and with it his soul 
 capable of simple UNK-345 and he was UNK-897 UNK-22 life like the UNK-239 
 shell of the moon . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  art thou pale for UNK-890 
 UNK-0  of climbing heaven and UNK-248 on the earth 
 UNK-0  UNK-254 UNK-221 . . . ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he repeated to himself the lines of UNK-374 UNK-365 . its UNK-119 
 of sad human UNK-577 with vast UNK-504 cycles of activity 
 UNK-35 him and he forgot his own human and UNK-125 UNK-344 .

 UNK-8 mother and his brother and one of his UNK-565 UNK-56 at the 
 corner of quiet foster place while he and his father went up the steps 
 and along the UNK-795 where the highland UNK-915 was UNK-586 . when 
 they had passed into the great hall and stood at the counter stephen 
 drew forth his orders on the governor of the bank of ireland for thirty 
 and three pounds and these UNK-994 the UNK-921 of his exhibition and 
 essay prize were paid over to him rapidly by the UNK-301 in notes and 
 in coin respectively . he UNK-813 them in his pockets with UNK-987 
 UNK-433 and suffered the friendly UNK-301 to whom his father UNK-549 
 to take his hand across the broad counter and wish him a brilliant 
 career in after life . he was UNK-114 of their voices and could not 
 keep his feet at rest . but the UNK-301 still deferred the serving of 
 others to say he was living in changed times and that there was nothing 
 like giving a boy the best education that money could buy . mr UNK-1 
 UNK-668 in the hall UNK-248 about him and up at the roof and telling 
 stephen who UNK-318 him to come out that they were standing in the 
 house of commons of the old irish parliament . 
 UNK-0 
 god help us ! he said UNK-515 to think of the men of those times 
 stephen UNK-741 UNK-938 and flood and henry UNK-597 and charles UNK-252 
 UNK-784 and the UNK-265 we have now leaders of the irish people at 
 home and abroad . why by god they UNK-9 be seen dead in a UNK-126 
 field with them . no stephen old UNK-26 im sorry to say that they are 
 only as i UNK-705 out one fine may morning in the merry month of sweet 
 july . 
 UNK-0 
 a keen october wind was blowing round the bank . the three figures 
 standing at the edge of the UNK-249 path had UNK-53 UNK-145 and UNK-138 
 eyes . stephen looked at his UNK-141 UNK-379 mother and remembered that a 
 few days before he had seen a UNK-939 priced at twenty UNK-472 in the 
 windows of UNK-252 . 
 UNK-0 
 well thats done said mr UNK-1 . 
 UNK-0 
 we had better go to dinner said stephen . where ? 
 UNK-0 
 dinner ? said mr UNK-1 . well i suppose we had better what ? 
 UNK-0 
 some place thats not too dear said mrs UNK-1 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-894 ? 
 UNK-0 
 yes . some quiet place . 
 UNK-0 
 come along said stephen quickly . it UNK-55 matter about the 
 UNK-182 . 
 UNK-0 
 he walked on before them with short nervous steps UNK-21 . they tried 
 to keep up with him UNK-21 also at his UNK-700 . 
 UNK-0 
 take it easy like a good young fellow said his father . were not 
 out for the half mile are we ? 
 UNK-0 
 for a swift season of UNK-852 the money of his prizes ran through 
 UNK-8 fingers . great UNK-879 of UNK-242 and UNK-462 and dried 
 fruits arrived from the city . every day he drew up a bill of fare for 
 the family and every night led a party of three or four to the theatre 
 to see UNK-608 or the lady of UNK-152 . in his coat pockets he carried 
 UNK-500 of vienna chocolate for his guests while his UNK-48 pocket 
 UNK-871 with UNK-152 of silver and copper coins . he bought presents for 
 everyone UNK-285 his room wrote out resolutions UNK-717 his 
 books up and down their UNK-891 UNK-162 upon all kinds of price lists 
 drew up a form of commonwealth for the household by which every member 
 of it held some office opened a loan bank for his family and pressed 
 loans on willing UNK-965 so that he might have the pleasure of making 
 out UNK-190 and UNK-832 the interests on the UNK-994 UNK-256 . when he 
 could do no more he drove up and down the city in UNK-301 . then the 
 season of pleasure came to an end . the pot of pink UNK-37 paint gave out 
 and the UNK-473 of his bedroom remained with its UNK-368 and 
 UNK-419 coat . 
 UNK-0 
 his household returned to its usual way of life . his mother had no 
 further occasion to UNK-355 him for UNK-862 his money . he too 
 returned to his old life at school and all his novel enterprises fell 
 to pieces . the commonwealth fell the loan bank closed its UNK-129 and 
 its books on a UNK-629 loss the rules of life which he had drawn 
 about himself fell into UNK-950 . 
 UNK-0 
 how UNK-735 his aim had been ! he had tried to build a UNK-589 of 
 order and UNK-916 against the UNK-815 tide of life without him and to 
 dam up by rules of conduct and active interest and new UNK-27 
 relations the powerful UNK-839 of the UNK-655 within him . UNK-453 . 
 from without as from within the waters had UNK-760 over his barriers 
 their UNK-655 began once more to UNK-661 UNK-809 above the UNK-991 UNK-360 . 
 UNK-0 
 he saw clearly too his own UNK-931 isolation . he had not gone one step 
 UNK-221 the lives he had sought to approach nor UNK-332 the UNK-741 
 shame and UNK-87 that had divided him from mother and brother and 
 sister . he felt that he was hardly of the one blood with them but stood 
 to them rather in the UNK-738 UNK-628 of UNK-358 UNK-547 and 
 UNK-474 . 
 UNK-0 
 he turned to UNK-998 the UNK-562 UNK-102 of his heart before which 
 everything else was idle and alien . he UNK-394 little that he was in 
 UNK-235 sin that his life had grown to be a tissue of UNK-120 and 
 UNK-735 . beside the savage desire within him to realize the 
 UNK-733 which he UNK-444 on nothing was sacred . he UNK-135 UNK-783 
 with the UNK-402 details of his secret UNK-987 in which he UNK-161 to 
 UNK-213 with UNK-435 whatever image had UNK-57 his eyes . by day and 
 by night he moved among UNK-451 images of the outer world . a figure 
 that had seemed to him by day UNK-139 and innocent came towards him by 
 night through the UNK-407 darkness of sleep her face UNK-547 by a 
 UNK-469 UNK-650 her eyes bright with UNK-545 joy . only the morning 
 UNK-588 him with its dim memory of dark UNK-803 UNK-306 its keen and 
 UNK-302 sense of UNK-848 . 
 UNK-0 
 he returned to his UNK-884 . the UNK-585 UNK-112 UNK-648 led him 
 from street to street as they had led him years before along the quiet 
 UNK-18 of UNK-853 . but no vision of trim front gardens or of UNK-320 
 lights in the windows UNK-207 a tender influence upon him now . only at 
 times in the UNK-446 of his desire when the luxury that was UNK-214 
 him gave room to a UNK-43 UNK-389 the image of mercedes UNK-319 the 
 background of his memory . he saw again the small white house and the 
 garden of UNK-471 on the road that led to the mountains and he 
 remembered the UNK-542 proud UNK-359 of UNK-592 which he was to make 
 there standing with her in the UNK-84 garden after years of 
 UNK-483 and adventure . at those moments the soft speeches of 
 UNK-50 UNK-159 rose to his lips and UNK-458 his UNK-927 . a tender 
 UNK-946 touched him of the UNK-35 he had then looked forward to and 
 in UNK-300 of the horrible reality which lay between his hope of then and 
 now of the holy encounter he had then UNK-747 at which UNK-688 and 
 UNK-777 and UNK-170 were to fall from him . 
 UNK-0 
 such moments passed and the UNK-214 fires of UNK-431 UNK-418 up again . the 
 UNK-351 passed from his lips and the UNK-693 UNK-155 and the UNK-555 
 brutal words UNK-939 forth from his brain to force a passage . his blood 
 was in UNK-978 . he UNK-326 up and down the dark UNK-415 streets UNK-639 
 into the UNK-286 of lanes and UNK-400 listening UNK-433 for any sound . 
 he UNK-84 to himself like some UNK-25 UNK-491 beast . he wanted to sin 
 with another of his kind to force another being to sin with him and to 
 UNK-866 with her in sin . he felt some dark presence moving UNK-987 
 upon him from the darkness a presence subtle and UNK-637 as a flood 
 filling him UNK-571 with itself . its UNK-208 UNK-544 his ears like the 
 UNK-208 of some UNK-431 in sleep its subtle streams UNK-810 his 
 being . his hands UNK-867 UNK-334 and his teeth set together as he 
 suffered the UNK-386 of its penetration . he UNK-269 out his arms in the 
 street to hold fast the UNK-422 UNK-158 form that UNK-494 him and UNK-971 
 him and the cry that he had UNK-648 for so long in his throat issued 
 from his lips . it broke from him like a UNK-673 of UNK-85 from a hell of 
 UNK-768 and died in a UNK-673 of UNK-942 UNK-282 a cry for an 
 UNK-483 UNK-350 a cry which was but the echo of an UNK-223 
 UNK-792 which he had read on the UNK-516 wall of a UNK-107 . 
 UNK-0 
 he had UNK-326 into a UNK-39 of narrow and dirty streets . from the foul 
 UNK-542 he heard UNK-836 of UNK-445 UNK-306 and UNK-88 and the UNK-150 
 of UNK-355 UNK-63 . he walked UNK-90 UNK-785 wondering whether he 
 had UNK-135 into the quarter of the jews . women and girls dressed in 
 long UNK-606 UNK-208 UNK-319 the street from house to house . they were 
 UNK-855 and UNK-630 . a UNK-178 UNK-457 him and his eyes grew dim . 
 the yellow UNK-908 UNK-507 before his UNK-371 vision against the 
 UNK-763 sky burning as if before an UNK-92 . before the doors and in the 
 UNK-340 UNK-80 groups were gathered UNK-655 as for some UNK-11 . he was in 
 another world he had UNK-329 from a UNK-60 of centuries . 
 UNK-0 
 he stood still in the middle of the UNK-992 his heart UNK-901 
 against his UNK-186 in a UNK-906 . a young woman dressed in a long pink 
 UNK-748 laid her hand on his arm to UNK-296 him and UNK-84 into his face . 
 she said UNK-219 
 UNK-0 
 good night UNK-638 dear ! 
 UNK-0 
 her room was warm and UNK-605 . a huge doll sat with her legs apart in 
 the UNK-436 UNK-176 beside the bed . he tried to bid his tongue speak 
 that he might seem at ease watching her as she UNK-939 her UNK-748 UNK-141 
 the proud conscious movements of her UNK-630 head . 
 UNK-0 
 as he stood silent in the middle of the room she came over to him and 
 UNK-448 him UNK-219 and UNK-141 . her round arms held him UNK-419 to her 
 and he seeing her face UNK-64 to him in serious calm and feeling the 
 warm calm rise and fall of her breast all but burst into UNK-422 
 UNK-984 . tears of joy and relief UNK-493 in his UNK-649 eyes and his 
 lips UNK-621 though they would not speak . 
 UNK-0 
 she passed her UNK-850 hand through his hair calling him a little 
 UNK-738 . 
 UNK-0 
 give me a kiss she said . 
 UNK-0 
 his lips would not bend to kiss her . he wanted to be held UNK-419 in her 
 arms to be UNK-349 slowly slowly slowly . in her arms he felt that 
 he had suddenly become strong and UNK-520 and sure of himself . but his 
 lips would not bend to kiss her . 
 UNK-0 
 with a sudden movement she UNK-170 his head and joined her lips to his 
 and he read the meaning of her movements in her frank UNK-387 eyes . it 
 was too much for him . he closed his eyes UNK-522 himself to her 
 body and mind conscious of nothing in the world but the dark pressure 
 of her UNK-41 UNK-370 lips . they pressed upon his brain as upon his 
 lips as though they were the vehicle of a UNK-209 speech and between 
 them he felt an unknown and UNK-183 pressure UNK-13 than the UNK-318 of 
 sin UNK-43 than sound or UNK-143 .

 the swift december UNK-322 had come UNK-311 UNK-973 after its UNK-66 day 
 and as he UNK-156 through the UNK-66 square of the window of the 
 UNK-242 he felt his belly UNK-178 for its food . he hoped there would 
 be UNK-773 for dinner UNK-755 and UNK-5 and UNK-931 potatoes and fat 
 UNK-811 pieces to be UNK-357 out in thick UNK-942 UNK-151 sauce . 
 stuff it into you his belly UNK-728 him . 
 UNK-0 
 it would be a UNK-484 secret night . after early UNK-351 the yellow 
 lamps would light up here and there the UNK-707 quarter of the 
 UNK-205 . he would follow a UNK-952 course up and down the streets 
 UNK-748 always UNK-221 and UNK-221 in a UNK-673 of fear and joy until 
 his feet led him suddenly round a dark corner . the UNK-264 would be just 
 coming out of their houses making ready for the night UNK-687 UNK-838 
 after their sleep and UNK-571 the UNK-716 in their clusters of hair . 
 he would pass by them UNK-331 waiting for a sudden movement of his own 
 will or a sudden call to his UNK-214 soul from their soft UNK-630 
 flesh . yet as he UNK-710 in quest of that call his UNK-344 UNK-90 
 only by his desire would note UNK-345 all that UNK-110 or UNK-919 them 
 his eyes a ring of porter UNK-75 on a UNK-730 table or a photograph 
 of two soldiers standing to attention or a UNK-959 UNK-389 his ears 
 the UNK-150 UNK-994 of greeting 
 UNK-0 
 hello UNK-44 any good in your mind ? 
 UNK-0 
 is that you UNK-61 ? 
 UNK-0 
 number ten . fresh UNK-468 is waiting on you . 
 UNK-0 
 good night husband ! coming in to have a short time ? 
 UNK-0 
 the equation on the page of his UNK-675 began to spread out a 
 UNK-612 tail eyed and UNK-599 like a UNK-46 and when the eyes 
 and stars of its indices had been UNK-899 began slowly to fold 
 itself together again . the indices appearing and UNK-161 were eyes 
 opening and closing the eyes opening and closing were stars being born 
 and being UNK-56 . the vast cycle of UNK-278 life UNK-135 his UNK-129 mind 
 UNK-375 to its UNK-762 and UNK-362 to its centre a distant music 
 accompanying him UNK-375 and UNK-362 . what music ? the music came UNK-221 
 and he UNK-225 the words the words of UNK-374 UNK-365 upon the 
 moon UNK-254 UNK-221 pale for UNK-890 . the stars began to 
 UNK-895 and a cloud of fine UNK-73 fell through space . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-66 light fell more UNK-284 upon the page UNK-45 another equation 
 began to UNK-393 itself slowly and to spread abroad its UNK-612 tail . 
 it was his own soul going forth to experience UNK-549 itself sin by 
 sin spreading abroad the UNK-145 of its burning stars and folding 
 back upon itself UNK-546 slowly UNK-779 its own lights and fires . 
 they were UNK-56 and the cold darkness filled chaos . 
 UNK-0 
 a cold UNK-804 UNK-506 UNK-137 in his soul . at his first violent sin 
 he had felt a wave of UNK-880 pass out of him and had UNK-60 to find 
 his body or his soul UNK-826 by the excess . instead the vital wave had 
 carried him on its UNK-186 out of himself and back again when it UNK-437 
 and no part of body or soul had been UNK-826 but a dark peace had been 
 established between them . the chaos in which his UNK-242 UNK-914 
 itself was a cold UNK-942 knowledge of himself . he had UNK-251 
 UNK-158 not once but many times and he knew that while he stood in 
 danger of eternal UNK-414 for the first sin alone by every 
 UNK-525 sin he UNK-133 his UNK-824 and his punishment . his days and 
 works and thoughts could make no UNK-768 for him the UNK-359 of 
 UNK-719 grace having UNK-167 to refresh his soul . at most by an 
 UNK-265 given to a UNK-806 whose UNK-697 he UNK-706 from he might hope 
 UNK-853 to win for himself some measure of actual grace . UNK-796 had 
 gone by the board . what did it UNK-761 to pray when he knew that his soul 
 UNK-742 after its own destruction ? a certain pride a certain UNK-994 
 UNK-454 him from offering to god even one prayer at night though he 
 knew it was in gods power to take away his life while he UNK-613 and 
 UNK-957 his soul UNK-599 UNK-971 he could UNK-429 for mercy . his pride in his own 
 sin his UNK-941 UNK-994 of god told him that his UNK-0 was too 
 UNK-137 to be UNK-731 for in whole or in part by a false UNK-77 to the 
 UNK-653 and UNK-794 . 
 UNK-0 
 well now UNK-844 i declare you have a head and so has my stick ! do 
 you mean to say that you are not able to tell me what a UNK-892 is ? 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-729 answer UNK-937 the UNK-601 of his UNK-251 of his 
 UNK-13 . towards others he felt neither shame nor fear . on sunday 
 UNK-521 as he passed the church door he UNK-75 UNK-482 at the 
 UNK-903 who stood UNK-639 four deep outside the church 
 UNK-137 present at the mass which they could neither see nor hear . 
 their UNK-66 UNK-101 and the UNK-879 smell of the cheap UNK-590 with which 
 they had UNK-19 their heads UNK-457 him from the UNK-92 they UNK-124 
 at . he UNK-109 to the evil of UNK-818 with others UNK-8 of their 
 UNK-636 which he could UNK-702 so easily . 
 UNK-0 
 on the wall of his bedroom hung an UNK-300 scroll the certificate 
 of his UNK-166 in the college of the UNK-173 of the blessed virgin 
 mary . on saturday UNK-521 when the UNK-173 met in the chapel to 
 UNK-754 the little office his place was a UNK-817 UNK-48 at the 
 right of the UNK-92 from which he led his wing of boys through the 
 responses . the UNK-735 of his position did not pain him . if at 
 moments he felt an UNK-231 to rise from his post of UNK-88 and 
 UNK-478 before them all his UNK-207 to leave the chapel a 
 glance at their faces UNK-259 him . the UNK-439 of the UNK-636 of 
 UNK-195 UNK-485 his UNK-239 pride . the UNK-440 of mary held his soul 
 UNK-792 UNK-397 and UNK-240 and UNK-821 UNK-641 her royal 
 UNK-763 her UNK-614 the UNK-610 plant and UNK-794 
 tree UNK-641 the UNK-240 UNK-671 growth of her UNK-731 among men . 
 when it fell to him to read the lesson towards the close of the office 
 he read it in a UNK-585 voice UNK-898 his UNK-212 to its music .

 his sin which had covered him from the sight of god had led him 
 UNK-221 to the UNK-324 of UNK-608 . her eyes seemed to regard him with 
 mild UNK-47 her UNK-800 a strange light UNK-808 UNK-284 upon her UNK-422 
 flesh did not UNK-46 the UNK-473 who UNK-596 her . if ever he was

 UNK-950 UNK-831 after the UNK-956 of his UNK-285 UNK-431 had spent itself 
 was turned towards her whose UNK-949 is the morning star bright and 
 musical telling of heaven and UNK-916 peace it was when her names 
 were UNK-203 UNK-41 by lips UNK-45 there still UNK-668 foul and 
 UNK-402 words the UNK-40 itself of a UNK-361 kiss . 
 UNK-0 
 that was strange . he tried to think how it could be . but the UNK-322 
 UNK-191 in the UNK-242 covered over his thoughts . the bell UNK-459 . 
 the master marked the UNK-994 and cuts to be done for the next lesson and 
 went out . UNK-149 beside stephen began to UNK-897 UNK-635 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 my excellent friend UNK-925 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-844 who had gone to the yard came back saying 
 UNK-0 
 the boy from the house is coming up for the UNK-96 . 
 UNK-0 
 a tall boy behind stephen UNK-866 his hands and said 
 UNK-0 
 thats game ball . we can UNK-204 the whole hour . he UNK-19 be in till 
 after half two . then you can ask him questions on the UNK-694 
 UNK-1 . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-200 back and drawing UNK-864 on his UNK-675 UNK-126 to 
 the talk about him which UNK-149 checked from time to time by saying 
 UNK-0 
 shut up will you . dont make such a UNK-485 UNK-209 ! 
 UNK-0 
 it was strange too that he found an UNK-863 pleasure in following up to 
 the end the UNK-974 lines of the UNK-713 of the church and UNK-995 
 into UNK-960 UNK-530 only to hear and feel the more deeply his own 
 UNK-562 . the sentence of saint james which says that he who 
 UNK-646 against one UNK-858 becomes guilty of all had seemed to him 
 first a UNK-672 phrase until he had begun to UNK-514 in the darkness 
 of his own state . from the evil seed of UNK-431 all other deadly 
 UNK-104 had UNK-103 forth pride in himself and UNK-251 of others 
 UNK-28 in using money for the purchase of UNK-132 UNK-744 
 UNK-934 of those whose UNK-552 he could not reach to and UNK-899 
 UNK-289 against the UNK-290 UNK-873 UNK-786 of food 
 the UNK-66 UNK-5 anger UNK-22 which he UNK-444 upon his UNK-868 the 
 UNK-437 of spiritual and UNK-919 UNK-830 in which his whole being had UNK-796 . 
 UNK-0 
 as he sat in his bench UNK-248 UNK-331 at the UNK-176 UNK-295 UNK-142 face 
 his mind wound itself in and out of the curious questions proposed to 
 it . if a man had stolen a pound in his youth and had used that pound to 
 UNK-612 a huge fortune how much was he UNK-499 to give back the pound he 
 had stolen only or the pound together with the compound interest 
 UNK-910 upon it or all his huge fortune ? if a UNK-776 in giving UNK-786 
 pour the water before saying the words is the child UNK-558 ? is 
 UNK-786 with a mineral water valid ? how comes it that while the first 
 UNK-133 promises the kingdom of heaven to the poor of heart the 
 second UNK-133 promises also to the UNK-965 that they shall possess the 
 land ? why was the UNK-511 of the UNK-47 UNK-3 under the two 
 species of bread and wine if jesus christ be present body and blood 
 soul and UNK-154 in the bread alone and in the wine alone ? does a 
 tiny particle of the UNK-854 bread contain all the body and blood 
 of jesus christ or a part only of the body and blood ? if the wine 
 change into UNK-112 and the host UNK-895 into corruption after they 
 have been UNK-854 is jesus christ still present under their 
 species as god and as man ? 
 UNK-0 
 here he is ! here he is ! 
 UNK-0 
 a boy from his post at the window had seen the UNK-96 come from the 
 house . all the UNK-700 were opened and all heads bent upon them 
 UNK-173 . the UNK-96 entered and took his seat on the UNK-798 . a gentle 
 kick from the tall boy in the bench behind UNK-318 stephen to ask a 
 difficult question . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-96 did not ask for a UNK-694 to hear the lesson from . he 
 UNK-669 his hands on the desk and said 
 UNK-0 
 the retreat will begin on wednesday afternoon in UNK-88 of saint 
 francis UNK-124 whose UNK-555 day is saturday . the retreat will go on from 
 wednesday to friday . on friday UNK-343 will be heard all the 
 afternoon after beads . if any boys have special UNK-276 perhaps it 
 will be better for them not to change . mass will be on saturday morning 
 at nine UNK-270 and general UNK-415 for the whole college . saturday 
 will be a free day . but saturday and sunday being free days some boys 
 might be UNK-444 to think that monday is a free day also . UNK-974 of 
 making that mistake . i think you UNK-196 are likely to make that 
 mistake . 
 UNK-0 
 i sir ? why sir ? 
 UNK-0 
 a little wave of quiet UNK-899 broke forth over the class of boys from 
 the UNK-176 UNK-771 smile . UNK-8 heart began slowly to fold and UNK-247 
 with fear like a UNK-809 flower . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-96 went on UNK-141 
 UNK-0 
 you are all familiar with the story of the life of saint francis 
 UNK-124 i suppose the UNK-186 of your college . he came of an old and 
 UNK-692 spanish family and you remember that he was one of the 
 first UNK-374 of saint UNK-77 . they met in paris where francis 
 UNK-124 was professor of philosophy at the university . this young and 
 brilliant UNK-135 and man of letters entered heart and soul into the 
 ideas of our UNK-520 founder and you know that he at his own desire 
 was sent by saint UNK-77 to UNK-867 to the indians . he is called as 
 you know the UNK-246 of the UNK-667 . he went from country to country in 
 the east from africa to india from india to japan UNK-501 the 
 people . he is said to have UNK-558 as many as ten thousand UNK-311 
 in one month . it is said that his right arm had grown UNK-262 from 
 having been raised so often over the heads of those whom he UNK-558 . 
 he UNK-136 then to go to china to win still more souls for god but he 
 died of fever on the island of UNK-747 . a great saint saint francis 
 UNK-124 ! a great soldier of god ! 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-96 UNK-214 and then UNK-144 his UNK-669 hands before him went 
 on 
 UNK-0 
 he had the faith in him that moves mountains . ten thousand souls won 
 for god in a single month ! that is a true UNK-757 true to the UNK-595 
 of our order ad UNK-232 UNK-954 UNK-768 ! a saint who has great power in 
 heaven remember power to UNK-725 for us in our UNK-383 power to 
 obtain whatever we pray for if it be for the good of our souls power 
 above all to obtain for us the grace to UNK-350 if we be in sin . a great 
 saint saint francis UNK-124 ! a great fisher of souls ! 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-167 to shake his UNK-669 hands and UNK-807 them against his 
 UNK-133 looked right and left of them UNK-345 at his UNK-797 out of 
 his dark UNK-977 eyes . 
 UNK-0 
 in the silence their dark fire UNK-537 the UNK-322 into a UNK-950 glow . 
 UNK-8 heart had UNK-821 up like a flower of the desert that feels 
 the UNK-177 coming from UNK-450 .

 remember only thy last things and thou UNK-664 not sin for UNK-143 
 taken my dear little brothers in christ from the book of 
 UNK-847 seventh chapter UNK-283 verse . in the name of the 
 father and of the son and of the holy ghost . UNK-294 . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen sat in the front bench of the chapel . father UNK-297 sat at a 
 table to the left of the UNK-92 . he UNK-71 about his UNK-61 a heavy 
 UNK-382 his pale face was drawn and his voice broken with UNK-156 . the 
 figure of his old master so UNK-784 UNK-27 brought back to 
 UNK-8 mind his life at UNK-202 the wide UNK-615 UNK-61 
 with boys the square UNK-791 the little cemetery off the main avenue of 
 UNK-673 where he had UNK-181 of being buried the UNK-777 on the wall 
 of the UNK-129 where he lay sick the UNK-564 face of brother 
 michael . his soul as these memories came back to him became again a 
 UNK-337 soul . 
 UNK-0 
 we are assembled here today my dear little brothers in christ for 
 one brief moment far away from the busy UNK-527 of the outer world to 
 celebrate and to UNK-88 one of the greatest of saints the UNK-246 of 
 the UNK-667 the UNK-186 saint also of your college saint francis 
 UNK-124 . year after year for much longer than any of you my dear 
 little boys can remember or than i can remember the boys of this 
 college have met in this very chapel to make their annual retreat 
 before the UNK-555 day of their UNK-186 saint . time has gone on and 
 brought with it its changes . even in the last few years what changes 
 can most of you not remember ? many of the boys who sat in those front 
 UNK-674 a few years ago are perhaps now in distant lands in the 
 burning UNK-356 or UNK-364 in professional duties or in UNK-787 
 or UNK-710 over the vast UNK-110 of the deep or it may be already 
 called by the great god to another life and to the rendering up of 
 their UNK-350 . and still as the years roll by bringing with them 
 changes for good and bad the memory of the great saint is UNK-1 by 
 the boys of this college who make every year their annual retreat on 
 the days preceding the UNK-555 day set apart by our holy mother the 
 church to transmit to all the ages the name and fame of one of the 
 greatest sons of catholic spain . 
 UNK-0 
 now what is the meaning of this word retreat and why is it allowed 
 on all hands to be a most UNK-66 practice for all who desire to lead 
 before god and in the eyes of men a truly christian life ? a retreat my 
 dear boys UNK-658 a withdrawal for UNK-401 from the UNK-89 of our 
 life the UNK-89 of this UNK-503 world in order to examine the state 
 of our UNK-212 to reflect on the UNK-442 of holy religion and to 
 understand better why we are here in this world . during these few days 
 i intend to put before you some thoughts concerning the four last 
 things . they are as you know from your UNK-694 death UNK-623 
 hell and heaven . we shall try to understand them fully during these 
 few days so that we may UNK-881 from the understanding of them a lasting 
 benefit to our souls . and remember my dear boys that we have been 
 sent into this world for one thing and for one thing alone to do gods 
 holy will and to save our UNK-605 souls . all else is UNK-785 . one 
 thing alone is UNK-956 the salvation of ones soul . what UNK-526 it 
 profit a man to gain the whole world if he suffer the loss of his 
 UNK-605 soul ? ah my dear boys believe me there is nothing in this 
 UNK-640 world that can make up for such a loss . 
 UNK-0 
 i will ask you therefore my dear boys to put away from your minds 
 during these few days all UNK-6 thoughts whether of study or 
 pleasure or UNK-570 and to give all your attention to the state of 
 your souls . i need hardly remind you that during the days of the 
 retreat all boys are expected to preserve a quiet and UNK-290 UNK-686 
 and to UNK-431 all loud UNK-851 pleasure . the elder boys of course will 
 see that this custom is not UNK-255 and i look especially to the 
 UNK-881 and officers of the UNK-173 of our blessed lady and of the 
 UNK-173 of the holy angels to set a good example to their 
 UNK-727 . 
 UNK-0 
 let us try therefore to make this retreat in UNK-88 of saint 
 francis with our whole heart and our whole mind . gods UNK-697 will 
 then be upon all your years studies . but above and beyond all let 
 this retreat be one to which you can look back in after years when 
 maybe you are far from this college and among very different 
 UNK-6 to which you can look back with joy and UNK-213 and 
 give thanks to god for having granted you this occasion of UNK-889 the 
 first foundation of a UNK-290 UNK-176 UNK-891 christian life . and if 
 as may so happen there be at this moment in these UNK-674 any poor 
 soul who has had the UNK-971 UNK-974 to lose gods holy grace 
 and to fall into UNK-137 sin i UNK-717 trust and pray that this 
 retreat may be the turning point in the life of that soul . i pray to 
 god through the UNK-928 of his UNK-891 UNK-363 francis UNK-124 that such 
 a soul may be led to UNK-63 UNK-473 and that the holy UNK-415 on 
 saint UNK-398 day of this year may be a lasting UNK-869 between god 
 and that soul . for just and UNK-259 for saint and UNK-473 alike may 
 this retreat be a UNK-841 one . 
 UNK-0 
 help me my dear little brothers in christ . help me by your UNK-290 
 attention by your own UNK-796 by your UNK-375 UNK-686 . UNK-873 from 
 your minds all UNK-6 thoughts and think only of the last things 
 death UNK-623 hell and heaven . he who UNK-63 these things says 
 UNK-847 shall not sin for ever . he who UNK-63 the last things 
 will act and think with them always before his eyes . he will live a 
 good life and die a good death UNK-160 and knowing that if he has 
 UNK-499 much in this UNK-392 life it will be given to him a 
 UNK-175 and a UNK-192 more in the life to come in the kingdom 
 without UNK-336 UNK-697 my dear boys which i wish you from my heart 
 one and all in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy 
 ghost . UNK-294 ! 
 UNK-0 
 as he walked home with silent UNK-193 a thick fog seemed to UNK-505 
 his mind . he UNK-56 in UNK-435 of mind till it should lift and reveal 
 what it had hidden . he ate his dinner with UNK-110 UNK-437 and when the 
 meal was over and the UNK-441 plates lay abandoned on the table 
 he rose and went to the window clearing the thick UNK-974 from his mouth 
 with his tongue and licking it from his lips . so he had UNK-796 to the 
 state of a beast that UNK-920 his UNK-644 after meat . this was the end and 
 a UNK-90 UNK-133 of fear began to pierce the fog of his mind . he pressed 
 his face against the UNK-899 of the window and UNK-84 out into the 
 UNK-3 street . forms passed this way and that through the UNK-66 
 light . and that was life . the letters of the name of dublin lay heavily 
 upon his mind pushing one another UNK-740 UNK-763 and UNK-467 with slow 
 UNK-703 UNK-530 . his soul was UNK-129 and UNK-515 into a gross 
 UNK-985 UNK-655 ever deeper in its UNK-66 fear into a UNK-967 threatening 
 UNK-322 while the body that was his stood UNK-826 and UNK-47 
 UNK-248 out of UNK-554 eyes UNK-41 UNK-522 and human for a 
 UNK-254 god to UNK-855 upon . 
 UNK-0 
 the next day brought death and UNK-623 UNK-716 his soul slowly from 
 its UNK-826 UNK-85 . the UNK-90 UNK-133 of fear became a terror of 
 spirit as the UNK-445 voice of the UNK-530 UNK-299 death into his soul . he 
 suffered its UNK-386 . he felt the death UNK-915 touch the UNK-322 and 
 UNK-844 UNK-90 towards the heart the film of death UNK-931 the eyes the 
 bright centres of the brain UNK-914 one by one like lamps the 
 last UNK-893 UNK-516 upon the skin the UNK-7 of the dying UNK-477 
 the speech UNK-75 and UNK-254 and failing the heart UNK-316 
 UNK-284 and more UNK-284 all but UNK-151 the breath the poor 
 breath the poor UNK-41 human spirit UNK-260 and UNK-475 UNK-972 
 and UNK-437 in the throat . no help ! no help ! UNK-476 UNK-723 
 body to which he had UNK-941 was dying . into the grave with it . nail it 
 down into a wooden box the UNK-341 . carry it out of the house on the 
 UNK-61 of UNK-558 . UNK-243 it out of mens sight into a long hole 
 in the ground into the grave to UNK-137 to feed the mass of its UNK-420 
 UNK-768 and to be UNK-952 by UNK-958 UNK-117 rats . 
 UNK-0 
 and while the friends were still standing in tears by the UNK-453 the 
 soul of the UNK-473 was UNK-863 . at the last moment of consciousness the 
 whole UNK-392 life passed before the vision of the soul and UNK-971 it had 
 time to reflect the body had died and the soul stood UNK-10 before 
 the UNK-623 seat . god who had long been UNK-607 would then be 
 just . he had long been patient UNK-142 with the UNK-578 soul 
 giving it time to UNK-350 UNK-61 it yet UNK-401 . but that time had 
 gone . time was to sin and to enjoy time was to UNK-904 at god and at the 
 warnings of his holy church time was to UNK-13 his UNK-275 to UNK-499 
 his commands to UNK-311 ones fellow men to commit sin after sin and 
 to hide ones corruption from the sight of men . but that time was over . 
 now it was gods turn and he was not to be UNK-453 or UNK-901 . 
 every sin would then come forth from its UNK-910 place the most 
 UNK-622 against the divine will and the most UNK-797 to our poor 
 UNK-612 nature the UNK-516 UNK-428 and the most UNK-955 UNK-224 . 
 what did it UNK-761 then to have been a great emperor a great general a 
 UNK-902 UNK-600 the most learned of the learned ? all were as one 
 before the UNK-623 seat of god . he would reward the good and UNK-614 
 the wicked . one single instant was enough for the trial of a UNK-54 
 soul . one single instant after the UNK-285 death the soul had been 
 UNK-441 in the balance . the particular UNK-623 was over and the soul 
 had passed to the UNK-126 of UNK-120 or to the prison of UNK-758 or had 
 been UNK-383 UNK-816 into hell . 
 UNK-0 
 nor was that all . gods justice had still to be UNK-513 before men 
 after the particular there still remained the general UNK-623 . the 
 last day had come . the UNK-701 was at hand . the stars of heaven were 
 falling upon the earth like the UNK-391 cast by the UNK-257 which the 
 wind has UNK-491 . the sun the great UNK-138 of the universe had 
 become as UNK-657 of hair . the moon was UNK-691 . the UNK-605 was 
 as a scroll rolled away . the UNK-260 michael the prince of the 
 UNK-198 host appeared UNK-520 and terrible against the sky . with one 
 foot on the sea and one foot on the land he UNK-299 from the UNK-429 
 UNK-75 the UNK-271 death of time . the three UNK-281 of the 
 angel filled all the universe . time is time was but time shall be no 
 more . at the last blast the souls of universal humanity UNK-352 towards 
 the valley of UNK-101 rich and poor gentle and simple wise and 
 UNK-735 good and wicked . the soul of every human being that has ever 
 existed the souls of all those who shall yet be born all the sons and 
 daughters of adam all are assembled on that supreme day . and lo the 
 supreme judge is coming ! no longer the UNK-388 lamb of god no longer the 
 UNK-965 jesus of UNK-828 no longer the man of UNK-694 no longer the 
 good shepherd he is seen now coming upon the clouds in great power 
 and UNK-275 attended by nine UNK-77 of angels angels and UNK-96 
 UNK-319 powers and UNK-51 UNK-851 and UNK-450 UNK-451 
 and UNK-222 god UNK-620 god UNK-417 . he speaks and his voice 
 is heard even at the UNK-695 limits of space even in the UNK-756 
 UNK-533 . supreme judge from his sentence there will be and can be no 
 appeal . he calls the just to his side bidding them enter into the 
 kingdom the UNK-162 of UNK-120 prepared for them . the UNK-259 he UNK-57 
 from him UNK-273 in his UNK-563 UNK-275 UNK-991 from me ye UNK-657 
 into UNK-417 fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels . 
 o what UNK-386 then for the UNK-786 UNK-608 ! friend is UNK-516 apart from 
 friend children are UNK-516 from their parents UNK-624 from their 
 wives . the poor UNK-473 holds out his arms to those who were dear to him 
 in this UNK-392 world to those whose simple UNK-101 perhaps he made a 
 UNK-896 of to those who UNK-728 him and tried to lead him on the right 
 path to a kind brother to a loving sister to the mother and father 
 who loved him so UNK-383 . but it is too late the just turn away from 
 the UNK-640 UNK-100 souls which now appear before the eyes of all in 
 their UNK-455 and evil character . o you UNK-561 o you UNK-62 
 UNK-568 o you who present a smooth UNK-21 face to the world while 
 your soul within is a foul UNK-437 of sin how will it fare with you in 
 that terrible day ? 
 UNK-0 
 and this day will come shall come must come the day of death and the 
 day of UNK-623 . it is appointed unto man to die and after death the 
 UNK-623 . death is certain . the time and manner are UNK-481 whether 
 from long disease or from some unexpected accident the son of god 
 UNK-298 at an hour when you little expect him . be therefore ready every 
 moment seeing that you may die at any moment . death is the end of us 
 all . death and UNK-623 brought into the world by the sin of our 
 first parents are the dark UNK-592 that close our UNK-392 existence 
 the UNK-592 that open into the unknown and the UNK-768 UNK-592 through 
 which every soul must pass alone UNK-364 save by its good works 
 without friend or brother or parent or master to help it alone and 
 UNK-178 . let that thought be ever before our minds and then we UNK-216 
 sin . death a cause of terror to the UNK-473 is a blessed moment for 
 him who has walked in the right path UNK-120 the duties of his 
 station in life attending to his morning and evening prayers 
 UNK-781 the holy UNK-511 frequently and performing good and 
 UNK-607 works . for the UNK-290 and UNK-160 catholic for the just man 
 death is no cause of terror . was it not UNK-605 the great english 
 writer who when on his UNK-78 sent for the wicked young earl of 
 UNK-762 to let him see how a christian can meet his end ? he it is and he 
 alone the UNK-290 and UNK-160 christian who can say in his heart 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  o grave where is thy victory ? 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  o death where is thy UNK-691 ? 
 UNK-0 
 every word of it was for him . against his sin foul and secret the 
 whole UNK-880 of god was aimed . the UNK-20 knife had UNK-823 deeply 
 into his UNK-634 UNK-212 and he felt now that his soul was 
 UNK-19 in sin . yes the UNK-530 was right . gods turn had come . 
 like a beast in its UNK-127 his soul had UNK-89 down in its own UNK-374 but 
 the UNK-281 of the angels UNK-75 had driven him forth from the 
 darkness of sin into the light . the words of doom UNK-5 by the angel 
 UNK-155 in an instant his UNK-683 peace . the wind of the last 
 day UNK-299 through his mind his UNK-104 the UNK-481 UNK-776 of his 
 imagination UNK-706 before the hurricane UNK-327 like mice in their 
 terror and UNK-644 under a UNK-825 of hair . 
 UNK-0 
 as he UNK-112 the square walking UNK-94 the light UNK-31 of a 
 girl reached his burning ear . the UNK-422 gay sound UNK-245 his heart more 
 strongly than a UNK-75 blast and not UNK-708 to lift his eyes he 
 turned aside and UNK-84 as he walked into the shadow of the UNK-480 
 UNK-536 . shame rose from his UNK-102 heart and UNK-500 his whole being . 
 the image of emma appeared before him and under her eyes the flood of 
 shame UNK-939 forth UNK-772 from his heart . if she knew to what his mind 
 had UNK-833 her or how his UNK-821 UNK-431 had UNK-516 and UNK-334 upon 
 her UNK-636 ! was that UNK-848 love ? was that UNK-265 ? was that 
 poetry ? the UNK-815 details of his UNK-889 UNK-720 under his very UNK-304 . 
 the UNK-448 packet of pictures which he had hidden in the UNK-79 of 
 the fireplace and in the presence of whose UNK-211 or UNK-49 
 UNK-407 he lay for hours UNK-12 in thought and UNK-448 his UNK-395 
 dreams UNK-572 by UNK-319 creatures and by UNK-776 with UNK-494 
 jewel eyes the foul long letters he had written in the joy of guilty 
 UNK-343 and carried UNK-935 for days and days only to throw them 
 under cover of night among the grass in the corner of a field or 
 beneath some UNK-241 door in some UNK-592 in the UNK-707 where a girl 
 might come upon them as she walked by and read them UNK-935 . mad ! mad ! 
 was it possible he had done these things ? a cold UNK-893 broke out upon 
 his UNK-133 as the foul memories UNK-583 within his brain . 
 UNK-0 
 when the UNK-386 of shame had passed from him he tried to raise his soul 
 from its UNK-404 UNK-7 . god and the blessed virgin were too far 
 from him god was too great and UNK-977 and the blessed virgin too pure 
 and holy . but he UNK-747 that he stood near emma in a wide land and 
 UNK-970 and in tears bent and UNK-166 the UNK-213 of her sleeve . 
 UNK-0 
 in the wide land under a tender UNK-804 evening sky a cloud UNK-897 
 UNK-501 UNK-22 a pale green sea of heaven they stood together children 
 that had UNK-640 . their error had UNK-563 deeply gods UNK-275 though it 
 was the error of two children but it had not UNK-563 her whose beauty 
 is not like UNK-392 beauty dangerous to look upon but like the 
 morning star which is its UNK-949 bright and musical . the eyes were 
 not UNK-563 which she turned upon him nor UNK-664 . she placed 
 their hands together hand in hand and said speaking to their hearts 
 UNK-0 
 take hands stephen and emma . it is a beautiful evening now in 
 heaven . you have UNK-640 but you are always my children . it is one heart 
 that loves another heart . take hands together my dear children and 
 you will be happy together and your hearts will love each other . 
 UNK-0 
 the chapel was UNK-500 by the UNK-66 UNK-205 light that UNK-44 through 
 the UNK-42 UNK-418 and through the UNK-771 between the last blind and 
 the UNK-914 a shaft of wan light entered like a UNK-99 and touched the 
 UNK-206 UNK-528 of the UNK-213 upon the UNK-92 that UNK-834 like 
 the UNK-323 mail UNK-830 of angels . 
 UNK-0 
 rain was falling on the chapel on the garden on the college . it would 
 rain for ever UNK-963 . the water would rise inch by inch covering 
 the grass and UNK-536 covering the trees and houses covering the 
 UNK-152 and the mountain tops . all life would be UNK-293 off 
 UNK-963 birds men UNK-299 UNK-380 children UNK-963 
 floating UNK-656 UNK-22 the UNK-474 of the UNK-695 of the world . forty 
 days and forty nights the rain would fall till the waters covered the 
 face of the earth . 
 UNK-0 
 it might be . why not ? 
 UNK-0 
 hell has UNK-106 its soul and opened its mouth without any 
 UNK-185 UNK-0 taken my dear little brothers in christ jesus from the 
 book of UNK-494 fifth chapter UNK-618 verse . in the name of the 
 father and of the son and of the holy ghost . UNK-294 . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-530 took a UNK-425 watch from a pocket within his UNK-825 
 and having considered its dial for a moment in silence placed it 
 UNK-173 before him on the table . 
 UNK-0 
 he began to speak in a quiet tone . 
 UNK-0 
 adam and eve my dear boys were as you know our first parents 
 and you will remember that they were created by god in order that the 
 seats in heaven left UNK-841 by the fall of UNK-657 and his UNK-622 
 angels might be filled again . UNK-657 we are told was a son of the 
 morning a UNK-543 and mighty angel yet he fell he fell and there 
 fell with him a third part of the host of heaven he fell and was 
 UNK-383 with his UNK-622 angels into hell . what his sin was we UNK-216 
 say . UNK-758 consider that it was the sin of pride the UNK-578 
 thought UNK-290 in an instant non UNK-893 i will not serve . that 
 instant was his UNK-625 . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-563 the UNK-275 of god by the UNK-578 thought of one instant and 
 god cast him out of heaven into hell for ever . 
 UNK-0 
 adam and eve were then created by god and placed in eden in the 
 plain of UNK-170 that lovely garden UNK-842 with UNK-252 and 
 colour UNK-395 with UNK-829 vegetation . the UNK-520 earth gave them 
 her UNK-161 UNK-850 and birds were their willing UNK-478 they knew not 
 the UNK-319 our flesh is UNK-759 to disease and poverty and death all that 
 a great and generous god could do for them was done . but there was one 
 condition imposed on them by god UNK-268 to his word . they were not 
 to eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-194 my dear little boys they too fell . the devil once a UNK-160 
 angel a son of the morning now a foul UNK-97 came in the shape of a 
 UNK-36 the UNK-260 of all the UNK-850 of the field . he UNK-179 them . 
 he the fallen great one could not bear to think that man a being of 
 clay should possess the UNK-861 which he by his sin had UNK-474 
 for ever . he came to the woman the UNK-664 vessel and UNK-207 the 
 poison of his UNK-118 into her ear promising hero the UNK-566 
 of that promise UNK-605 if she and adam ate of the forbidden fruit they 
 would become as gods UNK-376 as god himself . eve UNK-941 to the UNK-813 of 
 the UNK-524 . she ate the apple and gave it also to adam who had not 
 the moral courage to resist her . the poison tongue of UNK-445 had done 
 its work . they fell . 
 UNK-0 
 and then the voice of god was heard in that garden calling his 
 creature man to account and michael prince of the UNK-198 host with 
 a sword of flame in his hand appeared before the guilty pair and drove 
 them forth from eden into the world the world of UNK-309 and 
 UNK-103 of UNK-320 and UNK-965 of labour and UNK-548 to 
 earn their bread in the UNK-893 of their UNK-195 . but even then how UNK-607 
 was god ! he took UNK-47 on our poor UNK-809 parents and promised that in 
 the UNK-252 of time he would send down from heaven one who would 
 redeem them make them once more children of god and UNK-652 to the 
 kingdom of heaven and that one that UNK-890 of fallen man was to be 
 gods only UNK-828 son the second person of the most blessed trinity 
 the eternal word . 
 UNK-0 
 he came . he was born of a virgin pure mary the virgin mother . he 
 was born in a poor UNK-612 in UNK-819 and lived as a UNK-369 UNK-431 
 for thirty years until the hour of his mission had come . and then 
 filled with love for men he went forth and called to men to hear the 
 new gospel . 
 UNK-0 
 did they listen ? yes they UNK-126 but would not hear . he was 
 UNK-457 and bound like a common criminal UNK-941 at as a fool set aside 
 to give place to a public UNK-508 UNK-276 with five thousand UNK-242 
 UNK-818 with a crown of UNK-4 UNK-74 through the streets by the 
 jewish UNK-708 and the roman UNK-331 UNK-627 of his UNK-829 and 
 UNK-681 upon a UNK-836 and his side was UNK-650 with a lance and from the 
 UNK-110 body of our lord water and blood issued continually . 
 UNK-0 
 yet even then in that hour of supreme UNK-386 our UNK-607 UNK-890 had 
 UNK-47 for UNK-205 . yet even there on the hill of UNK-455 he founded 
 the holy catholic church against which it is promised the gates of 
 hell shall not UNK-210 . he founded it upon the rock of ages and 
 UNK-771 it with his grace with UNK-598 and sacrifice and promised 
 that if men would UNK-823 the word of his church they would still enter 
 into eternal life but if after all that had been done for them they 
 still UNK-186 in their UNK-272 there remained for them an 
 UNK-162 of UNK-524 hell . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-20 voice UNK-443 . he UNK-214 joined his UNK-976 for an instant 
 UNK-621 them . then he UNK-604 
 UNK-0 
 now let us try for a moment to realize as far as we can the nature 
 of that UNK-126 of the UNK-100 which the justice of an UNK-563 god has 
 called into existence for the eternal punishment of UNK-608 . hell is a 
 UNK-466 and dark and UNK-109 prison an UNK-126 of UNK-808 and lost 
 souls filled with fire and smoke . the UNK-626 of this prison house 
 is UNK-808 designed by god to UNK-614 those who refused to be bound by 
 his laws . in UNK-392 UNK-172 the poor UNK-792 has at least some liberty 
 of movement were it only within the four walls of his cell or in the 
 UNK-484 yard of his prison . not so in hell . there by reason of the 
 great number of the UNK-100 the prisoners are UNK-574 together in their 
 awful prison the walls of which are said to be four thousand miles 
 thick and the UNK-100 are so UNK-944 bound and UNK-41 that as a 
 blessed saint saint UNK-305 writes in his book on UNK-505 they 
 are not even able to remove from the eye a worm that UNK-886 it . 
 UNK-0 
 they lie in exterior darkness . for remember the fire of hell gives 
 forth no light . as at the command of god the fire of the UNK-228 
 UNK-642 lost its heat but not its light so at the command of god the 
 fire of hell while UNK-129 the intensity of its heat burns 
 UNK-682 in darkness . it is a never ending storm of darkness dark 
 UNK-709 and dark smoke of burning UNK-209 UNK-22 which the bodies are 
 UNK-574 one upon another without even a UNK-332 of air . of all the 
 UNK-775 with which the land of the UNK-339 were UNK-102 one UNK-660 
 alone that of darkness was called horrible . what name then shall we 
 give to the darkness of hell which is to last not for three days alone 
 but for all UNK-162 ? 
 UNK-0 
 the horror of this UNK-466 and dark prison is increased by its awful 
 UNK-572 . all the UNK-374 of the world all the UNK-97 and UNK-974 of the 
 world we are told shall run there as to a vast UNK-374 UNK-669 when the 
 terrible UNK-653 of the last day has UNK-536 the world . the 
 UNK-209 too which burns there in such UNK-707 quantity UNK-523 all 
 hell with its UNK-111 UNK-572 and the bodies of the UNK-100 
 themselves UNK-222 such a UNK-442 UNK-143 that as saint UNK-188 
 says one of them alone would UNK-207 to UNK-608 the whole world . the 
 very air of this world that pure element becomes foul and 
 UNK-176 when it has been long enclosed . consider then what must be 
 the UNK-834 of the air of hell . imagine some foul and UNK-183 UNK-341 
 that has UNK-89 UNK-440 and UNK-722 in the grave a UNK-408 mass 
 of liquid corruption . imagine such a UNK-341 a UNK-659 to UNK-709 UNK-952 
 by the fire of burning UNK-209 and giving off dense UNK-553 UNK-96 of 
 UNK-694 UNK-778 UNK-751 . and then imagine this UNK-434 
 UNK-572 UNK-133 a UNK-740 and a UNK-740 again from the 
 millions upon millions of UNK-998 UNK-416 UNK-413 together in the 
 UNK-374 darkness a huge and UNK-440 human UNK-981 . imagine all this 
 and you will have some idea of the horror of the UNK-572 of hell . 
 UNK-0 
 but this UNK-572 is not horrible though it is the greatest physical 
 UNK-524 to which the UNK-100 are UNK-833 . the UNK-524 of fire is the 
 greatest UNK-524 to which the UNK-896 has ever UNK-833 his fellow 
 creatures . place your finger for a moment in the flame of a candle and 
 you will feel the pain of fire . but our UNK-392 fire was created by god 
 for the benefit of man to maintain in him the UNK-125 of life and to 
 help him in the useful arts whereas the fire of hell is of another 
 quality and was created by god to torture and UNK-614 the UNK-846 
 UNK-473 . our UNK-392 fire also UNK-248 more or less rapidly according 
 as the object which it attacks is more or less UNK-838 so that 
 human UNK-976 has even UNK-427 in UNK-632 chemical UNK-448 
 to check or UNK-690 its action . but the UNK-132 UNK-209 which 
 burns in hell is a substance which is specially designed to burn for 
 ever and for ever with UNK-849 UNK-558 . moreover our UNK-392 fire 
 UNK-434 at the same time as it burns so that the more intense it is 
 the shorter is its duration but the fire of hell has this property 
 that it UNK-805 that which it burns and though it UNK-33 with 
 incredible intensity it UNK-33 for ever . 
 UNK-0 
 our UNK-392 fire again no matter how UNK-562 or widespread it may be 
 is always of a limited extent but the lake of fire in hell is 
 UNK-521 UNK-300 and UNK-756 . it is on record that the devil 
 himself when asked the question by a certain soldier was UNK-499 to 
 UNK-313 that if a whole mountain were thrown into the burning ocean of 
 hell it would be UNK-416 up in an instant like a piece of wax . and this 
 terrible fire will not UNK-157 the bodies of the UNK-100 only from 
 without but each lost soul will be a hell unto itself the UNK-521 
 fire UNK-668 in its very UNK-87 . o how terrible is the lot of those 
 UNK-640 beings ! the blood UNK-776 and UNK-675 in the UNK-692 the UNK-439 
 are UNK-365 in the UNK-241 the heart in the breast UNK-808 and UNK-412 
 the UNK-676 a UNK-148 mass of burning UNK-399 the tender eyes UNK-600 like 
 UNK-820 balls . 
 UNK-0 
 and yet what i have said as to the strength and quality and 
 UNK-455 of this fire is as nothing when compared to its 
 intensity an intensity which it has as being the instrument chosen by 
 divine design for the punishment of soul and body alike . it is a fire 
 which proceeds directly from the UNK-99 of god working not of its own 
 activity but as an instrument of divine UNK-183 . as the waters of 
 UNK-786 UNK-870 the soul with the body so do the fires of punishment 
 torture the spirit with the flesh . every sense of the flesh is UNK-49 
 and every faculty of the soul UNK-943 the eyes with UNK-69 
 UNK-916 darkness the nose with UNK-8 UNK-940 the ears with UNK-793 and 
 UNK-128 and UNK-756 the taste with foul matter UNK-878 corruption 
 UNK-749 UNK-647 UNK-374 the touch with UNK-148 UNK-122 and UNK-253 
 with UNK-165 UNK-591 of flame . and through the several UNK-276 of the 
 UNK-344 the UNK-605 soul is UNK-49 UNK-682 in its very essence UNK-22 
 the UNK-204 upon UNK-204 of UNK-808 fires UNK-537 in the UNK-533 by the 
 UNK-563 UNK-275 of the UNK-620 god and UNK-41 into UNK-417 and 
 UNK-249 UNK-558 by the breath of the anger of the UNK-108 . 
 UNK-0 
 consider finally that the UNK-524 of this UNK-215 prison is 
 increased by the company of the UNK-100 themselves . evil company on 
 earth is so UNK-168 that the plants as if by UNK-375 UNK-387 from 
 the company of UNK-303 is deadly or UNK-177 to them . in hell all 
 laws are UNK-197 is no thought of family or country of 
 ties of relationships . the UNK-100 UNK-156 and UNK-509 at one another 
 their torture and rage UNK-561 by the presence of beings UNK-49 
 and UNK-668 like themselves . all sense of humanity is forgotten . the 
 UNK-793 of the suffering UNK-608 fill the UNK-368 corners of the vast 
 UNK-533 . the UNK-682 of the UNK-100 are full of UNK-705 against god and 
 of UNK-985 for their fellow UNK-768 and of UNK-147 against those souls 
 which were their UNK-323 in sin . in UNK-554 times it was the custom 
 to UNK-614 the UNK-186 the man who had raised his UNK-343 hand 
 against his father by casting him into the UNK-855 of the sea in a UNK-91 
 in which were placed a cock a monkey and a UNK-36 . the intention of 
 those UNK-851 who framed such a law which seems UNK-165 in our times 
 was to UNK-614 the criminal by the company of UNK-177 and UNK-375 
 UNK-850 . but what is the UNK-558 of those dumb UNK-850 compared with the 
 UNK-558 of UNK-817 which UNK-836 from the UNK-557 lips and UNK-620 
 UNK-485 of the UNK-100 in hell when they UNK-972 in their UNK-193 in 
 UNK-736 those who UNK-602 and UNK-798 them in sin those whose words UNK-0 
 the first seeds of evil thinking and evil living in their minds those 
 whose UNK-462 suggestions led them on to sin those whose eyes UNK-508 
 and UNK-22 them from the path of virtue . they turn upon those 
 UNK-323 and UNK-355 them and UNK-217 them . but they are UNK-41 and 
 UNK-172 it is too late now for UNK-473 . 
 UNK-0 
 last of all consider the UNK-728 UNK-524 to those UNK-100 souls 
 UNK-138 and UNK-508 alike of the company of the UNK-268 . these UNK-268 
 will UNK-157 the UNK-100 in two ways by their presence and by their 
 UNK-653 . we can have no idea of how horrible these UNK-268 are . saint 
 catherine of UNK-492 once saw a devil and she has written that rather 
 than look again for one single instant on such a UNK-728 monster she 
 would prefer to walk until the end of her life along a track of red 
 UNK-918 . these UNK-268 who were once beautiful angels have become as 
 UNK-455 and ugly as they once were beautiful . they UNK-896 and UNK-715 at the 
 lost souls whom they UNK-867 down to UNK-625 . it is they the foul UNK-808 
 who are made in hell the voices of UNK-212 . why did you sin ? why did 
 you UNK-545 an ear to the UNK-106 of friends ? why did you turn aside 
 from your UNK-290 practices and good works ? why did you not UNK-431 the 
 occasions of sin ? why did you not leave that evil companion ? why did 
 you not give up that UNK-361 UNK-158 that UNK-40 UNK-158 ? why did you not 
 listen to the UNK-883 of your UNK-708 ? why did you not even after 
 you had fallen the first or the second or the third or the fourth or 
 the UNK-744 time UNK-350 of your evil ways and turn to god who only 
 UNK-56 for your UNK-473 to UNK-422 you of your UNK-104 ? now the time 
 for UNK-473 has gone by . time is time was but time shall be no more ! 
 time was to sin in UNK-957 to UNK-818 in that UNK-830 and pride to 
 UNK-790 the UNK-132 to yield to the UNK-736 of your lower nature to 
 live like the UNK-850 of the field UNK-376 worse than the UNK-850 of the 
 field for they at least are but UNK-948 and have no reason to guide 
 them time was but time shall be no more . god spoke to you by so many 
 voices but you would not hear . you would not UNK-432 out that pride and 
 anger in your heart you would not restore those UNK-614 goods you 
 would not UNK-823 the UNK-315 of your holy church nor attend to your 
 religious duties you would not UNK-665 those wicked UNK-193 you 
 would not avoid those dangerous UNK-924 . such is the language of 
 those UNK-275 UNK-528 words of UNK-436 and of UNK-91 of UNK-985 
 and of UNK-731 . of UNK-731 yes ! for even they the very UNK-268 when 
 they UNK-251 sinned by such a sin as alone was compatible with such 
 UNK-204 UNK-978 a UNK-693 of the UNK-678 and they even they 
 the foul UNK-268 must turn away UNK-128 and UNK-772 from the 
 UNK-481 of those UNK-849 UNK-104 by which UNK-809 man UNK-611 
 and UNK-100 the temple of the holy ghost UNK-100 and UNK-812 himself . 
 UNK-0 
 o my dear little brothers in christ may it never be our lot to 
 hear that language ! may it never be our lot i say ! in the last day of 
 terrible UNK-832 i pray UNK-717 to god that not a single soul of 
 those who are in this chapel today may be found among those UNK-786 
 beings whom the great judge shall command to UNK-991 for ever from his 
 sight that not one of us may ever hear UNK-924 in his ears the awful 
 sentence of UNK-719 UNK-991 from me ye UNK-657 into UNK-417 fire 
 which was prepared for the devil and his angels ! 
 UNK-0 
 he came down the UNK-67 of the chapel his legs UNK-144 and the UNK-619 of 
 his head UNK-178 as though it had been touched by UNK-675 fingers . he 
 passed up the UNK-116 and into the UNK-366 along the walls of which 
 the UNK-660 and UNK-959 hung like UNK-153 UNK-91 UNK-19 
 and UNK-827 and UNK-377 . and at every step he UNK-60 that he had 
 already died that his soul had been UNK-876 forth of the UNK-816 of 
 his body that he was UNK-655 UNK-415 through space . 
 UNK-0 
 he could not grip the floor with his feet and sat heavily at his desk 
 opening one of his books at random and UNK-518 over it . every word for 
 him . it was true . god was UNK-783 . god could call him now call him as 
 he sat at his desk before he had time to be conscious of the UNK-913 . 
 god had called him . yes ? what ? yes ? his flesh UNK-680 together as it 
 felt the approach of the UNK-315 UNK-591 of UNK-709 dried up as it 
 felt about it the UNK-935 of UNK-547 air . he had died . yes . he was 
 UNK-863 . a wave of fire UNK-716 through his body the first . again a wave . 
 his brain began to glow . another . his brain was UNK-882 and UNK-565 
 within the UNK-185 UNK-32 of the UNK-241 . UNK-709 burst forth from his 
 UNK-241 like a UNK-835 UNK-527 like voices 
 UNK-0 
 hell ! hell ! hell ! hell ! hell ! 
 UNK-0 
 voices spoke near him 
 UNK-0 
 on hell . 
 UNK-0 
 i suppose he UNK-866 it into you well . 
 UNK-0 
 you bet he did . he put us all into a blue funk . 
 UNK-0 
 thats what you UNK-13 want and plenty of it to make you work . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-122 back UNK-458 in his desk . he had not died . god had UNK-344 him 
 still . he was still in the familiar world of the school . mr UNK-808 and 
 vincent UNK-149 stood at the window talking UNK-730 UNK-248 out at the 
 UNK-55 rain moving their heads . 
 UNK-0 
 i wish it would clear up . i had arranged to go for a spin on the 
 bike with some UNK-13 out by UNK-684 . but the roads must be 
 UNK-119 . 
 UNK-0 
 it might clear up sir . 
 UNK-0 
 the voices that he knew so well the common words the quiet of the 
 classroom when the voices UNK-214 and the silence was filled by the 
 sound of UNK-41 browsing cattle as the other boys UNK-279 their UNK-43 
 UNK-743 UNK-964 his UNK-620 soul . 
 UNK-0 
 there was still time . o mary UNK-324 of UNK-608 UNK-725 for him ! o 
 virgin UNK-658 save him from the gulf of death ! 
 UNK-0 
 the english lesson began with the hearing of the history . royal 
 persons favourites UNK-585 UNK-910 passed like UNK-483 UNK-683 
 behind their UNK-296 of names . all had died all had been UNK-863 . what did 
 it profit a man to gain the whole world if he lost his soul ? at last he 
 had understood and human life lay around him a plain of peace UNK-45 
 UNK-528 men UNK-420 in UNK-219 their dead sleeping under quiet 
 UNK-96 . the UNK-213 of his companion touched him and his heart was 
 touched and when he spoke to answer a question of his master he heard 
 his own voice full of the UNK-676 of UNK-551 and UNK-256 . 
 UNK-0 
 his soul UNK-443 back deeper into UNK-855 of UNK-638 peace no longer able 
 to suffer the pain of UNK-230 and sending forth as he UNK-443 a UNK-90 
 prayer . ah yes he would still be UNK-344 he would UNK-350 in his heart 
 and be UNK-963 and then those above those in heaven would see what 
 he would do to make up for the past a whole life every hour of life . 
 only wait . 
 UNK-0 
 all god ! all all ! 
 UNK-0 
 a messenger came to the door to say that UNK-67 were being heard 
 in the chapel . four boys left the room and he heard others passing 
 down the UNK-366 . a UNK-993 UNK-915 UNK-299 round his heart no stronger 
 than a little wind and yet listening and suffering UNK-173 he 
 seemed to have laid an ear against the muscle of his own heart feeling 
 it close and UNK-588 listening to the UNK-782 of its UNK-93 . 
 UNK-0 
 no escape . he had to UNK-313 to speak out in words what he had done 
 and thought sin after sin . how ? how ? 
 UNK-0 
 father i . . . 
 UNK-0 
 the thought UNK-712 like a cold UNK-160 UNK-917 into his tender flesh 
 UNK-343 . but not there in the chapel of the college . he would 
 UNK-313 all every sin of UNK-448 and thought UNK-807 but not there 
 among his school UNK-193 . far away from there in some dark place he 
 would UNK-208 out his own shame and he UNK-997 god UNK-970 not to be 
 UNK-563 with him if he did not dare to UNK-313 in the college chapel 
 and in UNK-916 UNK-825 of spirit he UNK-180 UNK-258 UNK-925 of the 
 UNK-848 hearts about him . 
 UNK-0 
 time passed . 
 UNK-0 
 he sat again in the front bench of the chapel . the UNK-917 without was 
 already failing and as it fell slowly through the UNK-66 red UNK-418 it 
 seemed that the sun of the last day was going down and that all souls 
 were being gathered for the UNK-623 . 
 UNK-0 
 i am cast away from the sight of UNK-232 eyes words taken my dear 
 little brothers in christ from the book of UNK-636 UNK-695 chapter 
 UNK-378 verse . in the name of the father and of the son and of the 
 holy ghost . UNK-294 . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-530 began to speak in a quiet friendly tone . his face was kind 
 and he joined gently the fingers of each hand forming a UNK-422 cage by 
 the union of their tips . 
 UNK-0 
 this morning we UNK-542 in our reflection upon hell to make 
 what our holy founder calls in his book of spiritual exercises the 
 composition of place . we UNK-542 that is to imagine with the 
 UNK-344 of the mind in our imagination the material character of that 
 awful place and of the physical UNK-276 which all who are in hell UNK-932 . 
 this evening we shall consider for a few moments the nature of the 
 spiritual UNK-276 of hell . 
 UNK-0 
 sin remember is a UNK-479 UNK-887 . it is a base consent to the 
 UNK-736 of our UNK-612 nature to the lower UNK-21 to that which 
 is gross and UNK-953 and it is also a turning away from the counsel 
 of our higher nature from all that is pure and holy from the holy god 
 himself . for this reason UNK-235 sin is UNK-344 in hell by two 
 different forms of punishment physical and spiritual . 
 UNK-0 
 now of all these spiritual UNK-931 by far the greatest is the pain of 
 loss so great in fact that in itself it is a UNK-524 greater than 
 all the others . saint thomas the greatest doctor of the church the 
 UNK-98 doctor as he is called says that the worst UNK-414 consists 
 in this that the understanding of man is totally UNK-285 of divine 
 light and his UNK-874 UNK-118 turned away from the UNK-403 of 
 god . god remember is a being UNK-145 good and therefore the loss 
 of such a being must be a loss UNK-145 painful . in this life we have 
 not a very clear idea of what such a loss must be but the UNK-100 in 
 hell for their greater UNK-524 have a full understanding of that 
 which they have lost and understand that they have lost it through 
 their own UNK-104 and have lost it for ever . at the very instant of death 
 the bonds of the flesh are broken UNK-742 and the soul at once UNK-714 
 towards god as towards the centre of her existence . remember my dear 
 little boys our souls long to be with god . we come from god we live 
 by god we belong to god we are his UNK-624 his . god loves with a 
 divine love every human soul and every human soul lives in that love . 
 how could it be otherwise ? every breath that we draw every thought of 
 our brain every instant of life proceeds from gods UNK-205 
 UNK-403 . and if it be pain for a mother to be UNK-621 from her child 
 for a man to be UNK-578 from UNK-679 and home for friend to be UNK-729 
 from friend o think what pain what UNK-644 it must be for the poor 
 soul to be UNK-87 from the presence of the UNK-88 good and loving 
 creator who has called that soul into existence from UNK-854 and 
 sustained it in life and loved it with an UNK-331 love . this 
 then to be separated for ever from its greatest good from god and to 
 feel the UNK-644 of that separation knowing full well that it is 
 UNK-652 this is the greatest UNK-524 which the created soul is 
 capable of bearing UNK-412 UNK-851 the pain of loss . 
 UNK-0 
 the second pain which will UNK-157 the souls of the UNK-100 in hell is 
 the pain of UNK-212 . just as in dead bodies UNK-768 are UNK-705 by 
 UNK-842 so in the souls of the lost there UNK-151 a UNK-989 
 UNK-246 from the UNK-842 of sin the UNK-691 of UNK-212 the 
 worm as pope innocent the third calls it of the triple UNK-691 . the 
 first UNK-691 UNK-45 by this UNK-165 worm will be the memory of past 
 UNK-744 . o what a UNK-348 memory will that be ! in the lake of 
 UNK-280 flame the proud king will remember the UNK-536 of his 
 court the wise but wicked man his libraries and instruments of 
 research the lover of artistic UNK-744 his UNK-525 and pictures and 
 other art treasures he who UNK-649 in the UNK-744 of the table his 
 gorgeous UNK-403 his dishes prepared with such UNK-125 his choice 
 wines the UNK-760 will remember his UNK-601 of gold the UNK-508 his 
 UNK-614 wealth the angry and UNK-142 and UNK-698 UNK-316 
 their UNK-898 of blood and violence in which they UNK-932 the UNK-40 
 and UNK-310 the UNK-849 and UNK-947 UNK-744 in which they 
 UNK-649 . they will remember all this and UNK-582 themselves and their 
 UNK-104 . for how UNK-786 will all those UNK-744 seem to the soul 
 UNK-475 to suffer in UNK-786 for ages and ages . how they will rage 
 and UNK-965 to think that they have lost the UNK-120 of heaven for the UNK-697 
 of earth for a few pieces of metal for UNK-398 UNK-42 for UNK-919 
 UNK-416 for a UNK-567 of the UNK-510 . they will UNK-350 indeed and 
 this is the second UNK-691 of the worm of UNK-212 a late and 
 UNK-723 UNK-234 for UNK-104 committed . divine justice UNK-746 that the 
 understanding of those UNK-786 UNK-600 be fixed continually on the 
 UNK-104 of which they were guilty and moreover as saint UNK-993 points 
 out god will UNK-326 to them his own knowledge of sin so that sin will 
 appear to them in all its UNK-455 UNK-953 as it appears to the eyes of 
 god himself . they will UNK-972 their UNK-104 in all their UNK-834 and 
 UNK-350 but it will be too late and then they will UNK-974 the good 
 occasions which they UNK-377 . this is the last and UNK-533 and most 
 UNK-165 UNK-691 of the worm of UNK-212 . the UNK-212 will say you had 
 time and opportunity to UNK-350 and would not . you were brought up 
 UNK-51 by your parents . you had the UNK-598 and grace and 
 UNK-28 of the church to aid you . you had the minister of god to 
 UNK-867 to you to call you back when you had UNK-135 to UNK-540 you 
 your UNK-104 no matter how many how UNK-21 if only you had 
 UNK-964 and UNK-619 . no . you would not . you UNK-560 the ministers 
 of holy religion you turned your back on the UNK-948 you 
 UNK-892 deeper and deeper in the UNK-417 of sin . god UNK-177 to you 
 threatened you UNK-877 you to return to him . o what shame what 
 UNK-736 ! the UNK-752 of the universe UNK-877 you a creature of clay to 
 love him who made you and to keep his law . no . you would not . and now 
 though you were to flood all hell with your tears if you could still 
 UNK-955 all that sea of UNK-473 would not gain for you what a single 
 tear of true UNK-473 shed during your UNK-235 life would have gained 
 for you . you UNK-814 now a moment of UNK-392 life UNK-700 to UNK-350 in 
 UNK-398 . that time is gone gone for ever . 
 UNK-0 
 such is the UNK-874 UNK-691 of UNK-212 the UNK-526 which UNK-886 the 
 very hearts core of the UNK-600 in hell so that filled with UNK-242 
 UNK-558 they UNK-217 themselves for their UNK-813 and UNK-217 the evil 
 UNK-193 who have brought them to such UNK-625 and UNK-217 the UNK-268 who 
 UNK-508 them in life and now UNK-896 them in UNK-162 and even UNK-81 and 
 UNK-217 the supreme being whose UNK-403 and UNK-435 they UNK-73 and 
 UNK-400 but whose justice and power they UNK-216 UNK-735 . 
 UNK-0 
 the next spiritual pain to which the UNK-100 are UNK-833 is the 
 pain of extension . man in this UNK-392 life though he be capable of 
 many UNK-473 is not capable of them all at once UNK-581 as one evil 
 UNK-122 and UNK-566 another just as one poison frequently UNK-122 
 another . in hell on the contrary one UNK-524 instead of 
 UNK-731 another UNK-317 it still greater force and moreover as 
 the internal UNK-538 are more perfect than the external UNK-344 so 
 are they more capable of suffering . just as every sense is UNK-367 
 with a fitting UNK-524 so is every spiritual faculty the fancy with 
 horrible images the sensitive faculty with alternate UNK-868 and rage 
 the mind and understanding with an interior darkness more terrible even 
 than the exterior darkness which UNK-870 in that UNK-348 prison . the 
 UNK-953 UNK-811 though it be which UNK-80 these UNK-105 souls is an 
 evil of UNK-521 extension of UNK-112 duration a UNK-728 state 
 of UNK-272 which we can UNK-253 realize unless we bear in mind the 
 UNK-887 of sin and the UNK-985 god bears to it . 
 UNK-0 
 opposed to this pain of extension and yet UNK-513 with it we have 
 the pain of intensity . hell is the centre of UNK-473 and as you know 
 things are more intense at their centres than at their UNK-368 points . 
 there are no UNK-118 or UNK-600 of any kind to UNK-933 or UNK-654 
 in the least the UNK-931 of hell . UNK-376 things which are good in 
 themselves become evil in hell . company elsewhere a source of comfort 
 to the UNK-367 will be there a UNK-61 UNK-524 knowledge so much 
 UNK-405 for as the chief good of the UNK-678 will there be UNK-956 
 worse than UNK-678 light so much UNK-167 by all creatures from the 
 lord of creation down to the UNK-307 plant in the forest will be 
 UNK-870 UNK-112 . in this life our UNK-694 are either not very long or 
 not very great because nature either UNK-188 them by habits or puts 
 an end to them by UNK-498 under their weight . but in hell the UNK-276 
 UNK-216 be overcome by UNK-158 for while they are of terrible intensity 
 they are at the same time of UNK-61 variety each pain so to speak 
 taking fire from another and UNK-13 that which has UNK-419 it 
 with a still UNK-847 flame . nor can nature escape from these intense 
 and various UNK-976 by UNK-293 to them for the soul is sustained 
 and maintained in evil so that its suffering may be the greater . 
 UNK-521 extension of UNK-524 incredible intensity of suffering 
 UNK-26 variety of UNK-925 is what the divine UNK-275 so 
 UNK-52 by UNK-608 demands this is what the UNK-800 of heaven 
 UNK-400 and set aside for the UNK-899 and low UNK-744 of the UNK-612 
 flesh requires this is what the blood of the innocent lamb of god 
 shed for the UNK-508 of UNK-608 UNK-334 upon by the UNK-331 of the 
 UNK-200 UNK-746 upon . 
 UNK-0 
 last and UNK-829 torture of all the UNK-976 of that awful place is 
 the UNK-162 of hell . UNK-162 ! o UNK-230 and UNK-889 word . UNK-162 ! what 
 mind of man can understand it ? and remember it is an UNK-162 of pain . 
 even though the UNK-931 of hell were not so terrible as they are yet 
 they would become infinite as they are UNK-81 to last for ever . but 
 while they are UNK-417 they are at the same time as you know 
 UNK-686 intense UNK-402 extensive . to bear even the UNK-691 of an 
 UNK-23 for all UNK-162 would be a UNK-348 UNK-524 . what must it be 
 then to bear the UNK-101 UNK-976 of hell for ever ? for ever ! for all 
 UNK-162 ! not for a year or for an age but for ever . try to imagine the 
 awful meaning of this . you have often seen the sand on the UNK-596 . 
 how fine are its tiny UNK-947 ! and how many of those tiny little UNK-947 
 go to make up the small UNK-335 which a child UNK-211 in its play . now 
 imagine a mountain of that sand a million miles high reaching from 
 the earth to the UNK-695 UNK-100 and a million miles broad 
 extending to UNK-368 space and a million miles in thickness 
 and imagine such an enormous mass of UNK-910 particles of sand 
 UNK-133 as often as there are leaves in the forest drops of water 
 in the mighty ocean UNK-217 on birds scales on fish UNK-189 on 
 animals UNK-543 in the vast UNK-110 of the air and imagine that at the 
 end of every million years a little bird came to that mountain and 
 carried away in its UNK-935 a tiny grain of that sand . how many millions 
 upon millions of centuries would pass before that bird had carried away 
 even a square foot of that mountain how many UNK-470 upon UNK-470 of ages 
 before it had carried away all ? yet at the end of that UNK-557 stretch 
 of time not even one instant of UNK-162 could be said to have ended . 
 at the end of all those UNK-687 and UNK-973 of years UNK-162 would 
 have UNK-253 begun . and if that mountain rose again after it had been 
 all carried away and if the bird came again and carried it all away 
 again grain by grain and if it so rose and UNK-443 as many times as there 
 are stars in the sky UNK-543 in the air drops of water in the sea 
 leaves on the trees UNK-217 upon birds scales upon fish UNK-189 upon 
 animals at the end of all those UNK-304 UNK-545 and UNK-260 of 
 that UNK-323 vast mountain not one single instant of UNK-162 
 could be said to have ended even then at the end of such a period 
 after that UNK-861 of time the mere thought of which makes our very brain 
 reel UNK-364 UNK-162 would UNK-253 have begun . 
 UNK-0 
 a holy saint one of our own fathers i believe it was was once 
 UNK-169 a vision of hell . it seemed to him that he stood in the 
 UNK-619 of a great hall dark and silent save for the UNK-356 of a great 
 clock . the UNK-356 went on UNK-967 and it seemed to this saint 
 that the sound of the UNK-356 was the UNK-790 UNK-446 of the 
 UNK-103 never ever never . ever to be in hell never to be in heaven 
 ever to be shut off from the presence of god never to enjoy the 
 UNK-438 vision ever to be UNK-361 with UNK-709 UNK-416 by UNK-579 UNK-887 
 with burning UNK-253 never to be free from those UNK-931 ever to have 
 the UNK-212 UNK-355 one the memory UNK-295 the mind filled with 
 darkness and UNK-85 never to escape ever to UNK-217 and UNK-81 the 
 foul UNK-808 who UNK-612 UNK-710 over the UNK-736 of their UNK-403 never 
 to UNK-972 the UNK-160 UNK-242 of the blessed spirits ever to cry out 
 of the UNK-533 of fire to god for an instant a single instant of 
 UNK-843 from such awful UNK-386 never to receive even for an instant 
 gods UNK-906 ever to suffer never to enjoy ever to be UNK-100 never 
 to be saved ever never ever never . o what a UNK-348 punishment ! 
 an UNK-162 of endless UNK-386 of endless UNK-919 and spiritual UNK-524 
 without one ray of hope without one moment of UNK-981 of UNK-386 
 UNK-112 in intensity of UNK-524 UNK-145 varied of torture that 
 UNK-944 UNK-682 that which it UNK-682 UNK-856 of UNK-644 that 
 UNK-883 UNK-909 upon the spirit while it racks the flesh an 
 UNK-162 every instant of which is itself an UNK-162 of UNK-726 . such is 
 the terrible punishment UNK-935 for those who die in UNK-235 sin by an 
 UNK-783 and a just god . 
 UNK-0 
 yes a just god ! men reasoning always as men are UNK-647 that 
 god should UNK-952 out an UNK-417 and infinite punishment in the fires 
 of hell for a single UNK-137 sin . they reason thus because UNK-911 by 
 the gross UNK-995 of the flesh and the darkness of human 
 understanding they are unable to UNK-844 the UNK-455 UNK-953 of 
 UNK-235 sin . they reason thus because they are unable to UNK-844 that 
 even UNK-429 sin is of such a foul and UNK-455 nature that even if the 
 UNK-620 creator could end all the evil and UNK-736 in the world the 
 wars the diseases the UNK-823 the crimes the deaths the UNK-693 
 on condition that he allowed a single UNK-429 sin to pass UNK-90 a 
 single UNK-429 sin a lie an angry look a moment of UNK-20 UNK-830 he 
 the great UNK-620 god could not do so because sin be it in thought 
 or UNK-448 is a UNK-848 of his law and god would not be god if he 
 did not UNK-614 the UNK-873 . 
 UNK-0 
 a sin an instant of UNK-622 pride of the UNK-678 made UNK-657 
 and a third part of the UNK-373 of angels fall from their glory . a sin 
 an instant of UNK-813 and UNK-688 drove adam and eve out of eden and 
 brought death and suffering into the world . to retrieve the 
 consequences of that sin the only UNK-828 son of god came down to 
 earth lived and suffered and died a most painful death hanging for 
 three hours on the cross . 
 UNK-0 
 o my dear little UNK-466 in christ jesus will we then UNK-878 that 
 good UNK-890 and UNK-907 his anger ? will we UNK-408 again upon that 
 UNK-516 and UNK-547 UNK-341 ? will we UNK-750 upon that face so full of UNK-234 
 and love ? will we too like the UNK-165 jews and the brutal soldiers 
 UNK-896 that gentle and UNK-659 UNK-983 who UNK-190 alone for our sake 
 the awful UNK-530 of UNK-234 ? every word of sin is a wound in his 
 tender side . every UNK-578 act is a UNK-797 UNK-533 his head . every 
 UNK-40 thought UNK-177 UNK-941 to is a keen lance UNK-97 that 
 sacred and loving heart . no no . it is impossible for any human being to 
 do that which UNK-646 so deeply the divine UNK-275 that which is UNK-344 
 by an UNK-162 of UNK-386 that which UNK-774 again the son of god and 
 makes a UNK-756 of him . 
 UNK-0 
 i pray to god that my poor words may have UNK-201 today to confirm 
 in UNK-800 those who are in a state of grace to strengthen the 
 UNK-546 to lead back to the state of grace the poor soul that has 
 UNK-135 if any such be among you . i pray to god and do you pray with 
 me that we may UNK-350 of our UNK-104 . i will ask you now all of you to 
 repeat after me the act of UNK-256 UNK-755 here in this UNK-369 
 chapel in the presence of god . he is there in the UNK-601 burning 
 with love for UNK-205 ready to comfort the UNK-367 . be not afraid . 
 no matter how many or how foul the UNK-104 if you only UNK-350 of them they 
 will be UNK-963 you . let no UNK-6 shame hold you back . god is still 
 the UNK-607 lord who wishes not the eternal death of the UNK-473 but 
 rather that he be converted and live . 
 UNK-0 
 he calls you to him . you are his . he made you out of nothing . he 
 loved you as only a god can love . his arms are open to receive you even 
 though you have UNK-251 against him . come to him poor UNK-473 poor UNK-398 
 and UNK-470 UNK-473 . now is the acceptable time . now is the hour . 
 UNK-0 
 the priest rose and turning towards the UNK-92 UNK-97 upon the step 
 before the UNK-601 in the fallen UNK-286 . he UNK-56 till all in the 
 chapel had UNK-97 and every least noise was still . then raising his 
 head he repeated the act of UNK-256 phrase by phrase with 
 UNK-970 . the boys answered him phrase by phrase . stephen his tongue 
 UNK-557 to his UNK-201 UNK-170 his head UNK-725 with his heart .

 he went up to his room after dinner in order to be alone with his soul 
 and at every step his soul seemed to UNK-317 at every step his soul 
 mounted with his feet UNK-475 in the UNK-215 through a region of 
 UNK-442 UNK-286 . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-46 on the landing before the door and then UNK-559 the 
 porcelain UNK-269 opened the door quickly . he UNK-56 in fear his soul 
 UNK-87 within him UNK-725 UNK-173 that death might not touch his UNK-195 
 as he passed over the threshold that the UNK-516 that UNK-14 darkness 
 might not be given power over him . he UNK-56 still at the threshold as 
 at the entrance to some dark cave . faces were there eyes they UNK-56 
 and watched . 
 UNK-0 
 we knew perfectly well of course that though it was bound to come to 
 the light he would find considerable difficulty in UNK-932 to try 
 to UNK-602 himself to try to UNK-290 to UNK-9 the spiritual 
 UNK-350 and so we knew of course perfectly well 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-289 faces UNK-56 and watched UNK-637 voices filled the dark 
 shell of the cave . he UNK-60 UNK-112 in spirit and in flesh but 
 raising his head UNK-33 he UNK-536 into the room UNK-419 . a UNK-102 a 
 room the same room same window . he told himself UNK-331 that those 
 words had absolutely no sense which had seemed to rise UNK-380 from 
 the dark . he told himself that it was simply his room with the door 
 open . 
 UNK-0 
 he closed the door and walking UNK-171 to the bed UNK-97 beside it and 
 covered his face with his hands . his hands were cold and UNK-261 and his 
 UNK-477 UNK-183 with UNK-915 . UNK-919 UNK-927 and UNK-915 and UNK-890 UNK-964 
 him routing his thoughts . why was he UNK-755 there like a child 
 saying his evening prayers ? to be alone with his soul to examine his 
 UNK-212 to meet his UNK-104 face to face to recall their times and 
 UNK-347 and circumstances to UNK-955 over them . he could not UNK-955 . he 
 could not UNK-597 them to his memory . he felt only an UNK-223 of soul and 
 body his whole being memory will understanding flesh UNK-301 
 and UNK-129 . 
 UNK-0 
 that was the work of UNK-268 to UNK-370 his thoughts and UNK-56 his 
 UNK-212 UNK-716 him at the gates of the UNK-686 and 
 UNK-908 flesh and UNK-725 god UNK-686 to UNK-540 him his 
 UNK-688 he UNK-344 up on to the bed and wrapping the UNK-960 
 closely about him covered his face again with his hands . he had 
 UNK-251 . he had UNK-251 so deeply against heaven and before god that he 
 was not worthy to be called gods child . 
 UNK-0 
 could it be that he stephen UNK-1 had done those things ? his 
 UNK-212 UNK-279 in answer . yes he had done them UNK-935 UNK-953 
 time after time and UNK-333 in UNK-578 UNK-87 he had UNK-357 to 
 wear the mask of UNK-800 before the UNK-601 itself while his soul 
 within was a living mass of corruption . how came it that god had not 
 struck him dead ? the UNK-878 company of his UNK-104 closed about him 
 breathing upon him UNK-277 over him from all sides . he UNK-952 to 
 forget them in an act of prayer UNK-39 his UNK-477 closer together and 
 binding down his UNK-863 but the UNK-344 of his soul would not be bound 
 and though his eyes were shut fast he saw the places where he had 
 UNK-251 and though his ears were UNK-651 covered he heard . he desired 
 with all his will not to hear or see . he desired till his frame UNK-35 
 under the strain of his desire and until the UNK-344 of his soul closed . 
 they closed for an instant and then opened . he saw . 
 UNK-0 
 a field of UNK-257 UNK-861 and UNK-160 and UNK-511 UNK-452 . thick 
 among the UNK-274 of rank UNK-257 growth lay UNK-36 UNK-23 and UNK-283 
 and UNK-887 of solid UNK-337 . a UNK-90 UNK-786 UNK-875 UNK-356 
 from all the UNK-711 through the UNK-541 UNK-174 UNK-861 . an evil 
 smell UNK-90 and foul as the light UNK-827 UNK-356 UNK-682 out of 
 the UNK-23 and from the UNK-377 UNK-283 UNK-834 . 
 UNK-0 
 creatures were in the field one three six creatures were moving in 
 the field UNK-763 and UNK-467 . UNK-800 creatures with human faces 
 UNK-763 UNK-79 UNK-663 and grey as UNK-154 . the UNK-953 of 
 evil UNK-919 in their hard eyes as they moved UNK-763 and UNK-467 
 UNK-184 their long UNK-911 behind them . a UNK-220 of UNK-165 UNK-989 lit 
 up UNK-817 their old UNK-215 faces . one was UNK-621 about his UNK-905 a UNK-516 
 UNK-491 UNK-187 another UNK-373 UNK-757 as his UNK-153 stuck 
 in the UNK-511 UNK-861 . soft language issued from their UNK-575 lips 
 as they UNK-491 in slow circles round and round the field UNK-407 
 UNK-763 and UNK-467 through the UNK-861 UNK-873 their long UNK-911 UNK-22 
 the UNK-437 UNK-23 . they moved in slow circles UNK-748 closer and 
 closer to UNK-414 to UNK-414 soft language UNK-717 from their lips 
 their long UNK-730 UNK-911 UNK-368 with UNK-377 UNK-530 UNK-274 UNK-356 
 their UNK-92 faces . . . 
 UNK-0 
 help ! 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-168 the UNK-960 from him UNK-878 to free his face and neck . that 
 was his hell . god had allowed him to see the hell reserved for his 
 UNK-104 UNK-372 UNK-909 UNK-755 a hell of UNK-469 UNK-800 UNK-516 . 
 for him ! for him ! 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-418 from the bed the UNK-374 UNK-143 UNK-821 down his throat 
 UNK-213 and UNK-815 his UNK-662 . air ! the air of heaven ! he 
 UNK-886 towards the window UNK-388 and almost UNK-215 with 
 UNK-309 . at the UNK-109 a UNK-520 UNK-457 him within and 
 UNK-621 his cold UNK-133 UNK-659 he UNK-944 UNK-421 in UNK-386 . 
 UNK-0 
 when the fit had spent itself he walked UNK-458 to the window and 
 UNK-272 the UNK-914 sat in a corner of the UNK-100 and UNK-122 his UNK-213 
 upon the UNK-654 . the rain had drawn off and UNK-22 the moving UNK-171 from 
 point to point of light the city was UNK-785 about herself a soft 
 UNK-440 of UNK-487 UNK-704 . heaven was still and UNK-284 UNK-915 and the 
 air sweet to UNK-820 as in a UNK-228 UNK-952 with showers and UNK-22 
 peace and UNK-459 lights and quiet fragrance he made a UNK-869 with 
 his heart . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-124 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he once had meant to come on earth in UNK-198 glory but we UNK-251 and 
 then he could not safely visit us but with a UNK-629 UNK-275 and a 
 UNK-461 UNK-102 for he was god . so he came himself in UNK-688 not in 
 power and he sent thee a creature in his UNK-836 with a creatures 
 UNK-939 and UNK-341 suited to our state . and now thy very face and 
 form dear mother speak to us of the eternal not like UNK-392 beauty 
 dangerous to look upon but like the morning star which is thy UNK-949 
 bright and musical breathing UNK-591 telling of heaven and UNK-916 
 peace . o UNK-162 of day ! o light of the UNK-880 ! lead us still as 
 thou UNK-745 led . in the dark night across the UNK-55 wilderness guide us 
 on to our lord jesus guide us home . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 his eyes were UNK-718 with tears and looking UNK-970 up to heaven he 
 UNK-457 for the UNK-636 he had lost . 
 UNK-0 
 when evening had fallen he left the house and the first touch of the 
 UNK-261 dark air and the noise of the door as it closed behind him made 
 UNK-223 again his UNK-212 UNK-964 by prayer and tears . UNK-313 ! 
 UNK-313 ! it was not enough to UNK-841 the UNK-212 with a tear and a 
 prayer . he had to UNK-456 before the minister of the holy ghost and tell 
 over his hidden UNK-104 truly and UNK-634 . before he heard again the 
 UNK-915 of the UNK-32 trail over the threshold as it opened to let 
 him in before he saw again the table in the kitchen set for UNK-255 he 
 would have UNK-97 and UNK-964 . it was quite simple . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-223 of UNK-212 UNK-167 and he walked UNK-90 UNK-171 through the 
 dark streets . there were so many UNK-543 on the UNK-125 of that 
 street and so many streets in that city and so many cities in the 
 world . yet UNK-162 had no end . he was in UNK-235 sin . even once was a 
 UNK-235 sin . it could happen in an instant . but how so quickly ? by 
 seeing or by thinking of seeing . the eyes see the thing without having 
 UNK-136 first to see . then in an instant it happens . but does that part 
 of the body understand or what ? the UNK-36 the most subtle beast of 
 the field . it must understand when it UNK-46 in one instant and then 
 UNK-891 its own desire instant after instant UNK-964 . it feels and 
 UNK-240 and UNK-46 . what a horrible thing ! who made it to be like 
 that a UNK-909 part of the body able to understand UNK-513 and 
 desire UNK-513 ? was that then he or an UNK-504 thing moved by a lower 
 soul ? his soul UNK-64 at the thought of a UNK-792 UNK-476 life feeding 
 itself out of the tender UNK-729 of his life and UNK-129 upon the 
 UNK-124 of UNK-431 . o why was that so ? o why ? 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-303 in the shadow of the thought UNK-44 himself in the UNK-994 of 
 god who had made all things and all men . madness . who could think such 
 a thought ? and UNK-337 in darkness and UNK-404 he UNK-124 UNK-925 to 
 his guardian angel to drive away with his sword the UNK-105 that was 
 UNK-387 to his brain . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-365 UNK-167 and he knew then clearly that his own soul had 
 UNK-251 in thought and word and UNK-448 UNK-807 through his own body . 
 UNK-313 ! he had to UNK-313 every sin . how could he UNK-916 in words to 
 the priest what he had done ? must must . or how could he explain 
 without dying of shame ? or how could he have done such things without 
 shame ? a UNK-481 ! UNK-313 ! o he would indeed to be free and UNK-422 
 again ! perhaps the priest would know . o dear god ! 
 UNK-0 
 he walked on and on through UNK-321 streets UNK-143 to stand still for 
 a moment UNK-689 it might seem that he held back from what UNK-864 him 
 UNK-143 to arrive at that towards which he still turned with UNK-868 . 
 how beautiful must be a soul in the state of grace when god looked upon 
 it with love ! 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-353 girls sat along the UNK-894 before their baskets . their UNK-490 
 hair hung UNK-892 over their UNK-490 . they were not beautiful to see as 
 they UNK-752 in the UNK-417 . but their souls were seen by god and if 
 their souls were in a state of grace they were UNK-543 to see and god 
 loved them seeing them . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-214 breath of UNK-396 UNK-299 UNK-373 over his soul to think of 
 how he had fallen to feel that those souls were UNK-462 to god than 
 his . the wind UNK-299 over him and passed on to the UNK-477 and UNK-477 of 
 other souls on whom gods favour UNK-493 now more and now less stars now 
 UNK-367 and now UNK-539 sustained and failing . and the UNK-137 souls 
 passed away sustained and failing UNK-680 in a moving breath . 
 one soul was lost a tiny soul his . it UNK-254 once and went 
 out forgotten lost . the end black cold void waste . 
 UNK-0 
 consciousness of place came UNK-245 back to him slowly over a vast tract 
 of time UNK-698 UNK-107 UNK-601 . the UNK-707 scene composed itself 
 around him the common UNK-122 the burning UNK-923 in the shops 
 UNK-940 of fish and spirits and wet UNK-483 moving men and women . an 
 old woman was about to cross the street an UNK-724 in her hand . he bent 
 down and asked her was there a chapel near . 
 UNK-0 
 a chapel sir ? yes sir . church street chapel . 
 UNK-0 
 church ? 
 UNK-0 
 she UNK-12 the can to her other hand and directed him and as she 
 held out her UNK-374 UNK-821 right hand under its UNK-703 of UNK-975 he 
 bent lower towards her UNK-579 and UNK-485 by her voice . 
 UNK-0 
 thank you . 
 UNK-0 
 you are quite welcome sir . 
 UNK-0 
 the candles on the high UNK-92 had been UNK-914 but the fragrance 
 of UNK-402 still UNK-973 down the dim UNK-271 . UNK-663 UNK-166 with UNK-290 
 faces were UNK-147 a UNK-612 out through a side door the UNK-984 
 UNK-443 them with quiet UNK-746 and words . a few of the UNK-620 still 
 UNK-668 UNK-725 before one of the UNK-522 or UNK-755 in the 
 UNK-674 near the UNK-638 . he UNK-596 UNK-686 and UNK-97 at the 
 last bench in the body UNK-277 for the peace and silence and UNK-23 
 shadow of the church . the board on which he UNK-97 was narrow and worn 
 and those who UNK-97 near him were UNK-369 UNK-374 of jesus . jesus too 
 had been born in poverty and had worked in the shop of a UNK-431 
 cutting boards and UNK-415 them and had first spoken of the kingdom of 
 god to poor UNK-459 teaching all men to be UNK-965 and UNK-369 of heart . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-170 his head upon his hands bidding his heart be UNK-965 and UNK-369 
 that he might be like those who UNK-97 beside him and his prayer as 
 acceptable as UNK-75 . he UNK-124 beside them but it was hard . his soul 
 was foul with sin and he UNK-357 not ask UNK-258 with the simple 
 trust of those whom jesus in the mysterious ways of god had called 
 first to his side the UNK-945 the UNK-459 poor and simple 
 people following a UNK-388 trade handling and UNK-600 the wood of trees 
 UNK-938 their UNK-847 with UNK-435 . 
 UNK-0 
 a tall figure came down the UNK-67 and the UNK-855 UNK-937 and at the 
 last moment UNK-220 up UNK-171 he saw a long grey UNK-153 and the 
 brown UNK-158 of a UNK-252 . the priest entered the box and was hidden . 
 two UNK-855 rose and entered the UNK-948 at either side . the 
 wooden slide was drawn back and the UNK-90 UNK-208 of a voice UNK-371 
 the silence . 
 UNK-0 
 his blood began to UNK-208 in his UNK-692 UNK-289 like a UNK-578 city 
 UNK-960 from its sleep to hear its doom . little UNK-538 of fire fell 
 and UNK-288 UNK-460 fell UNK-41 UNK-690 on the houses of men . they 
 UNK-937 UNK-632 from sleep UNK-371 by the heated air . 
 UNK-0 
 the slide was shot back . the UNK-197 UNK-209 from the side of the box . 
 the UNK-199 side was drawn . a woman entered UNK-40 and UNK-765 where 
 the first UNK-197 had UNK-97 . the UNK-90 UNK-208 began again . 
 UNK-0 
 he could still leave the chapel . he could stand up put one foot before 
 the other and walk out UNK-41 and then run run run UNK-171 through 
 the dark streets . he could still escape from the shame . had it been any 
 terrible crime but that one sin ! had it been murder ! little UNK-163 
 UNK-538 fell and touched him at all points UNK-402 thoughts UNK-402 
 words UNK-402 acts . shame covered him UNK-571 like fine UNK-808 UNK-460 
 falling continually . to say it in words ! his soul UNK-547 and 
 UNK-41 would UNK-575 to be . 
 UNK-0 
 the slide was shot back . a UNK-197 UNK-209 from the UNK-199 side of 
 the box . the near slide was drawn . a UNK-197 entered where the other 
 UNK-197 had come out . a soft UNK-387 noise UNK-973 in UNK-551 
 UNK-78 out of the box . it was the woman soft UNK-387 UNK-78 
 soft UNK-387 UNK-575 UNK-387 and UNK-16 . 
 UNK-0 
 he beat his breast with his fist UNK-970 UNK-935 under cover of the 
 wooden UNK-889 . he would be at one with others and with god . he would 
 love his UNK-379 . he would love god who had made and loved him . he 
 would UNK-456 and pray with others and be happy . god would look down on 
 him and on them and would love them all . 
 UNK-0 
 it was easy to be good . gods UNK-817 was sweet and light . it was better 
 never to have UNK-251 to have remained always a child for god loved 
 little children and suffered them to come to him . it was a terrible and 
 a sad thing to sin . but god was UNK-607 to poor UNK-608 who were truly 
 sorry . how true that was ! that was indeed UNK-403 . 
 UNK-0 
 the slide was shot to suddenly . the UNK-197 came out . he was next . he 
 stood up in terror and walked UNK-288 into the box . 
 UNK-0 
 at last it had come . he UNK-97 in the silent UNK-286 and raised his eyes 
 to the white UNK-248 suspended above him . god could see that he was 
 sorry . he would tell all his UNK-104 . his UNK-343 would be long long . 
 everybody in the chapel would know then what a UNK-473 he had been . let 
 them know . it was true . but god had promised to UNK-540 him if he was 
 sorry . he was sorry . he UNK-669 his hands and raised them towards the 
 white form UNK-725 with his UNK-554 eyes UNK-725 with all his 
 UNK-178 body UNK-223 his head to and UNK-161 like a lost creature 
 UNK-725 with UNK-613 lips . 
 UNK-0 
 sorry ! sorry ! o sorry ! 
 UNK-0 
 the slide UNK-884 back and his heart UNK-885 in his breast . the face of 
 an old priest was at the UNK-59 UNK-922 from him UNK-200 upon a 
 hand . he made the sign of the cross and UNK-124 of the priest to bless 
 him for he had UNK-251 . then UNK-694 his head he repeated the UNK-775 
 in UNK-512 . at the words my most UNK-137 fault he UNK-167 UNK-21 . 
 UNK-0 
 how long is it since your last UNK-343 my child ? 
 UNK-0 
 a long time father . 
 UNK-0 
 a month my child ? 
 UNK-0 
 longer father . 
 UNK-0 
 three months my child ? 
 UNK-0 
 longer father . 
 UNK-0 
 six months ? 
 UNK-0 
 eight months father . 
 UNK-0 
 he had begun . the priest asked 
 UNK-0 
 and what do you remember since that time ? 
 UNK-0 
 he began to UNK-313 his UNK-104 UNK-152 missed prayers not said lies . 
 UNK-0 
 anything else my child ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-104 of anger UNK-934 of others UNK-202 UNK-385 UNK-634 . 
 UNK-0 
 anything else my child ? 
 UNK-0 
 there was no help . he UNK-203 
 UNK-0 
 i . . . committed UNK-104 of UNK-958 father . 
 UNK-0 
 the priest did not turn his head . 
 UNK-0 
 with yourself my child ? 
 UNK-0 
 and . . . with others . 
 UNK-0 
 with women my child ? 
 UNK-0 
 yes father . 
 UNK-0 
 were they married women my child ? 
 UNK-0 
 he did not know . his UNK-104 UNK-749 from his lips one by one UNK-749 
 in UNK-402 drops from his soul UNK-19 and UNK-516 like a UNK-713 a 
 UNK-707 stream of vice . the last UNK-104 UNK-586 forth UNK-336 UNK-947 . 
 there was no more to tell . he UNK-170 his head overcome . 
 UNK-0 
 the priest was silent . then he asked 
 UNK-0 
 how old are you my child ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-752 father . 
 UNK-0 
 the priest passed his hand several times over his face . then UNK-807 
 his UNK-133 against his hand he UNK-122 towards the UNK-59 and with 
 eyes still UNK-922 spoke slowly . his voice was UNK-129 and old . 
 UNK-0 
 you are very young my child he said and let me UNK-814 of you to 
 give up that sin . it is a terrible sin . it kills the body and it kills 
 the soul . it is the cause of many crimes and UNK-956 . give it up 
 my child for gods sake . it is UNK-921 and UNK-71 . you UNK-216 
 know where that UNK-640 UNK-158 will lead you or where it will come 
 against you . as long as you commit that sin my poor child you will 
 never be worth one UNK-407 to god . pray to our mother mary to help 
 you . she will help you my child . pray to our blessed lady when that 
 sin comes into your mind . i am sure you will do that will you not ? you 
 UNK-350 of all those UNK-104 . i am sure you do . and you will promise god 
 now that by his holy grace you will never UNK-878 him any more by that 
 wicked sin . you will make that UNK-384 promise to god will you not ? 
 UNK-0 
 yes father . 
 UNK-0 
 the old and UNK-129 voice fell like sweet rain upon his UNK-857 UNK-610 
 heart . how sweet and sad ! 
 UNK-0 
 do so my poor child . the devil has led you UNK-179 . drive him back to 
 hell when he UNK-286 you to UNK-181 your body in that UNK-797 foul 
 spirit who UNK-725 our lord . promise god now that you will give up that 
 sin that UNK-640 wretched sin . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-911 by his tears and by the light of gods UNK-395 he bent his 
 head and heard the grave words of UNK-344 spoken and saw the 
 UNK-73 hand raised above him in token of UNK-258 . 
 UNK-0 
 god bless you my child . pray for me . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-97 to say his UNK-934 UNK-725 in a corner of the dark UNK-271 and 
 his prayers UNK-3 to heaven from his UNK-402 heart like perfume 
 streaming UNK-356 from a heart of white rose . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-249 streets were gay . he UNK-536 UNK-94 conscious of an 
 invisible grace UNK-842 and making light his UNK-477 . in UNK-300 of all 
 he had done it . he had UNK-964 and god had UNK-253 him . his soul was 
 made fair and holy once more holy and happy . 
 UNK-0 
 it would be beautiful to die if god so UNK-21 . it was beautiful to live 
 in grace a life of peace and virtue and UNK-495 with others . 
 UNK-0 
 he sat by the fire in the kitchen not UNK-708 to speak for happiness . 
 till that moment he had not known how beautiful and peaceful life could 
 be . the green square of paper UNK-774 round the lamp cast down a tender

 the shelf there were eggs . they would be for the breakfast in the 
 morning after the UNK-415 in the college chapel . white UNK-494 and 
 eggs and UNK-254 and cups of tea . how simple and beautiful was life 
 after all ! and life lay all before him .

 in a dream he fell UNK-314 . in a dream he rose and saw that it was 
 morning . in a UNK-632 dream he went through the quiet morning towards

 happy and UNK-523 . the UNK-92 was UNK-574 with UNK-23 UNK-152 of white 
 flowers and in the morning light the pale UNK-709 of the candles among 
 the white flowers were clear and silent as his own soul .

 sunday was dedicated to the mystery of the holy trinity monday to the

 suffering jesus saturday to the blessed virgin mary . 
 UNK-0 
 every morning he UNK-664 himself UNK-772 in the presence of some holy 
 image or mystery . his day began with an UNK-718 offering of its every 
 moment of thought or action for the UNK-310 of the UNK-480 UNK-322 
 and with an early mass . the raw morning air UNK-593 his UNK-461 UNK-101 
 and often as he UNK-97 among the few UNK-903 at the UNK-310 
 following with his UNK-168 UNK-76 the UNK-208 of the priest he 
 UNK-75 up for an instant towards the UNK-534 figure standing in the 
 UNK-286 between the two candles which were the old and the new 
 UNK-568 and UNK-747 that he was UNK-755 at mass in the UNK-297 . 
 UNK-0 
 his daily life was laid out in UNK-391 areas . by means of 
 UNK-967 and prayers he stored up UNK-489 for the souls in 
 UNK-758 centuries of days and UNK-309 and years yet the 
 spiritual triumph which he felt in achieving with ease so many fabulous 
 ages of UNK-756 UNK-589 did not UNK-571 reward his UNK-432 of prayer 
 since he could never know how much temporal punishment he had UNK-967 
 by way of UNK-398 for the UNK-202 souls and UNK-883 UNK-689 in the 
 UNK-619 of the UNK-440 fire which UNK-709 from the UNK-215 only in 
 that it was not UNK-417 his UNK-934 might UNK-761 no more than a 
 drop of moisture he drove his soul daily through an increasing circle 
 of works of UNK-317 . 
 UNK-0 
 every part of his day divided by what he regarded now as the duties of 
 his station in life UNK-839 about its own centre of spiritual energy . 
 his life seemed to have drawn near to UNK-162 every thought word 
 and UNK-448 every instance of consciousness could be made to UNK-811 
 UNK-661 in heaven and at times his sense of such immediate 
 UNK-411 was so UNK-334 that he seemed to feel his soul in UNK-796 
 pressing like fingers the keyboard of a great cash register and to see 
 the amount of his purchase start forth immediately in heaven not as a 
 number but as a UNK-422 column of UNK-402 or as a UNK-293 flower . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-99 too which he said UNK-989 he carried his beads 
 loose in his UNK-48 pockets that he might tell them as he walked the 
 UNK-110 themselves into UNK-637 of flowers of such UNK-209 
 UNK-522 texture that they seemed to him as UNK-473 and UNK-984 as 
 they were UNK-749 . he offered up each of his three daily UNK-724 that 
 his soul might grow strong in each of the three UNK-519 UNK-51 in 
 faith in the father who had created him in hope in the son who had 
 UNK-801 him and in love of the holy ghost who had UNK-557 him and 
 this UNK-697 triple prayer he offered to the three persons through mary 
 in the name of her UNK-71 and UNK-564 and UNK-520 UNK-442 . 
 UNK-0 
 on each of the seven days of the week he further UNK-124 that one of the 
 seven gifts of the holy ghost might UNK-828 upon his soul and drive out 
 of it day by day the seven deadly UNK-104 which had UNK-978 it in the 
 past and he UNK-124 for each gift on its appointed day confident that 
 it would UNK-828 upon him though it seemed strange to him at times 
 that wisdom and understanding and knowledge were so distinct in their 
 nature that each should be UNK-124 for apart from the others . yet he 
 believed that at some future stage of his spiritual progress this 
 difficulty would be removed when his UNK-578 soul had been raised up 
 from its UNK-688 and UNK-598 by the third person of the most 
 blessed trinity . he believed this all the more and with UNK-127 
 because of the divine UNK-286 and silence UNK-700 UNK-210 the UNK-768 
 UNK-385 whose symbols were a UNK-127 and a mighty wind to sin against 
 whom was a sin beyond UNK-258 the eternal mysterious secret being 
 to whom as god the UNK-73 offered up mass once a year UNK-532 in the 
 UNK-205 of the UNK-591 of fire . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-439 through which the nature and UNK-628 of the three persons 
 of the trinity were UNK-326 UNK-932 forth in the books of UNK-796 
 which he UNK-218 father UNK-645 from all UNK-162 as in a 
 mirror his divine UNK-341 and thereby UNK-492 UNK-682 the 
 eternal son and the holy spirit proceeding out of father and son from 
 all UNK-124 easier of acceptance by his mind by reason of their 
 august UNK-949 than was the simple fact that god had loved 
 his soul from all UNK-162 for ages before he had been born into the 
 world for ages before the world itself had existed . 
 UNK-0 
 he had heard the names of the UNK-786 of love and hate UNK-363 
 UNK-505 on the stage and in the UNK-544 had found them set forth 
 UNK-505 in books and had UNK-105 why his soul was unable to harbour 
 them for any time or to force his lips to UNK-916 their names with 
 conviction . a brief anger had often UNK-890 him but he had never been 
 able to make it an UNK-629 passion and had always felt himself passing 
 out of it as if his very body were being UNK-423 with ease of some 
 outer skin or UNK-215 . he had felt a subtle dark and UNK-637 presence 
 UNK-258 his being and fire him with a brief UNK-483 UNK-431 it too 
 had UNK-728 beyond his UNK-111 leaving his mind UNK-804 and UNK-942 . 
 this it seemed was the only love and that the only hate his soul 
 would harbour . 
 UNK-0 
 but he could no longer UNK-64 in the reality of love since god 
 himself had loved his individual soul with divine love from all 
 UNK-162 . gradually as his soul was UNK-926 with spiritual knowledge 
 he saw the whole world forming one vast UNK-95 expression of gods 
 power and love . life became a divine gift for every moment and 
 UNK-393 of which were it even the sight of a single leaf hanging on 
 the UNK-558 of a tree his soul should praise and thank the UNK-599 . the 
 world for all its solid substance and complexity no longer existed for 
 his soul save as a theorem of divine power and love and UNK-969 . 
 so entire and UNK-366 was this sense of the divine meaning in 
 all nature granted to his soul that he could UNK-253 understand why it 
 was in any way necessary that he should continue to live . yet that was 
 part of the divine purpose and he UNK-357 not question its use he above 
 all others who had UNK-251 so deeply and so UNK-123 against the divine 
 purpose . UNK-965 and UNK-670 by this consciousness of the one eternal 
 UNK-687 perfect reality his soul took up again her burden of 
 UNK-362 UNK-152 and prayers and UNK-598 and UNK-427 and only 
 then for the first time since he had UNK-444 on the great mystery of 
 love did he feel within him a warm movement like that of some newly 
 born life or virtue of the soul itself . the attitude of UNK-809 in 
 sacred art the raised and UNK-621 hands the UNK-621 lips and eyes as of 
 one about to UNK-318 became for him an image of the soul in prayer 
 UNK-8 and UNK-90 before her creator . 
 UNK-0 
 but he had been UNK-462 of the UNK-519 of spiritual UNK-632 and 
 did not allow himself to UNK-699 from even the least or UNK-518 
 UNK-796 UNK-103 also by constant UNK-272 to undo the UNK-578 
 past rather than to achieve a UNK-935 UNK-968 with UNK-711 . each of 
 his UNK-344 was brought under a UNK-79 discipline . in order to UNK-55 
 the sense of sight he made it his rule to walk in the street with 
 UNK-571 eyes UNK-220 neither to right nor left and never behind him . 
 his eyes UNK-753 every encounter with the eyes of women . from time to 
 time also he UNK-420 them by a sudden effort of the will as by UNK-272 
 them suddenly in the middle of an UNK-368 sentence and closing the 
 book . to UNK-55 his hearing he UNK-313 no control over his voice which 
 was then breaking neither UNK-57 nor UNK-250 and made no attempt to 
 UNK-348 from UNK-304 which caused him painful nervous UNK-747 such as 
 the UNK-54 of knives on the knife board the gathering of UNK-186 
 on the UNK-277 and the UNK-210 of the carpet . to UNK-55 his smell 
 was more difficult as he found in himself no UNK-687 UNK-283 to 
 bad UNK-940 whether they were the UNK-940 of the outdoor world such as 
 those of UNK-834 or tar or the UNK-940 of his own person among which he 
 had made many curious comparisons and experiments . he found in the end 
 that the only UNK-143 against which his sense of smell UNK-128 was a 
 certain UNK-377 UNK-357 UNK-3 like that of UNK-497 UNK-380 and 
 whenever it was possible he UNK-833 himself to this UNK-144 UNK-143 . 
 to UNK-55 the taste he UNK-156 strict habits at table observed to 
 the letter all the UNK-667 of the church and sought by UNK-504 to 
 UNK-311 his mind from the UNK-775 of different foods . but it was to the 
 UNK-272 of touch he brought the most UNK-493 UNK-976 of 
 UNK-559 . he never UNK-622 changed his position in bed sat in 
 the most UNK-381 positions suffered UNK-321 every UNK-942 and 
 pain kept away from the fire remained on his UNK-111 all through the 
 mass except at the UNK-567 left part of his neck and face UNK-450 so 
 that air might UNK-691 them and whenever he was not saying his beads 
 carried his arms UNK-255 at his sides like a runner and never in his 
 pockets or UNK-669 behind him . 
 UNK-0 
 he had no UNK-924 to sin UNK-158 . it surprised him however to find 
 that at the end of his course of UNK-49 UNK-101 and UNK-465 he 
 was so easily at the mercy of UNK-191 and UNK-150 UNK-383 . his 
 prayers and UNK-667 UNK-201 him little for the UNK-923 of anger at 
 hearing his mother UNK-207 or at being disturbed in his UNK-975 . it 
 needed an UNK-557 effort of his will to master the UNK-231 which UNK-318 
 him to give outlet to such UNK-747 . images of the UNK-168 of 
 UNK-168 anger which he had often noted among his masters their 
 UNK-269 UNK-682 UNK-303 lips and UNK-327 UNK-145 UNK-898 to his 
 memory UNK-659 him for all his practice of UNK-551 by the 
 comparison . to merge his life in the common tide of other lives was 
 harder for him than any UNK-372 or prayer and it was his constant 
 failure to do this to his own satisfaction which caused in his soul at 
 last a UNK-393 of spiritual UNK-795 together with a growth of UNK-507 
 and UNK-95 . his soul UNK-319 a period of UNK-540 in which the 
 UNK-598 themselves seemed to have turned into UNK-388 sources . his 
 UNK-343 became a channel for the escape of UNK-789 and UNK-267 
 UNK-383 . his actual reception of the UNK-47 did not bring him 
 the same UNK-596 moments of UNK-159 UNK-299 as did those 
 spiritual UNK-552 made by him sometimes at the close of some visit 
 to the blessed UNK-511 . the book which he used for these visits was 
 an old UNK-377 book written by saint UNK-405 UNK-929 with UNK-546 
 characters and UNK-838 UNK-497 leaves . a UNK-238 world of UNK-479 love 
 and UNK-159 responses seemed to be UNK-685 for his soul by the reading 
 of its pages in which the UNK-439 of the UNK-48 was UNK-639 with 
 the UNK-97 prayers . an UNK-572 voice seemed to UNK-806 the 
 soul telling her names and UNK-440 bidding her arise as for UNK-787 
 and come away bidding her look forth a spouse from UNK-860 and from 
 the mountains of the UNK-494 and the soul seemed to answer with the 
 same UNK-572 voice UNK-522 herself inter UNK-687 UNK-591 
 UNK-494 . 
 UNK-0 
 this idea of UNK-245 had a UNK-609 attraction for his mind now that 
 he felt his soul UNK-964 once again by the UNK-74 voices of the flesh 
 which began to UNK-208 to him again during his prayers and UNK-348 . 
 it gave him an intense sense of power to know that he could by a 
 single act of consent in a moment of thought undo all that he had 
 done . he seemed to feel a flood slowly UNK-796 towards his naked feet 
 and to be waiting for the first UNK-90 UNK-183 UNK-85 UNK-348 to touch 
 his UNK-588 skin . then almost at the instant of that touch almost at 
 the UNK-762 of UNK-578 consent he found himself standing far away from 
 the flood upon a dry shore saved by a sudden act of the will or a 
 sudden ejaculation and seeing the silver line of the flood far away 
 and beginning again its slow advance towards his feet a new UNK-447 of 
 power and satisfaction UNK-35 his soul to know that he had not UNK-941 
 nor UNK-882 all . 
 UNK-0 
 when he had UNK-494 the flood of UNK-563 many times in this way he 
 grew UNK-371 and UNK-105 whether the grace which he had refused to 
 lose was not being UNK-16 from him little by little . the clear 
 UNK-50 of his own UNK-775 grew dim and to it UNK-427 a UNK-209 fear 
 that his soul had really fallen UNK-973 . it was with difficulty that 
 he won back his old consciousness of his state of grace by telling 
 himself that he had UNK-124 to god at every UNK-563 and that the 
 grace which he had UNK-124 for must have been given to him UNK-581 as 
 god was UNK-499 to give it . the very frequency and violence of 
 UNK-924 showed him at last the truth of what he had heard about the 
 trials of the saints . frequent and violent UNK-924 were a proof 
 that the UNK-375 of the soul had not fallen and that the devil UNK-880 to 
 make it fall . 
 UNK-0 
 often when he had UNK-964 his UNK-507 and UNK-882 UNK-88 
 UNK-30 at prayer a movement of UNK-168 anger in his soul or a 
 subtle UNK-413 in speech or UNK-859 was UNK-334 by his UNK-708 to 
 name some sin of his past life before UNK-344 was given him . he 
 named it with UNK-551 and shame and UNK-619 of it once more . it 
 UNK-8 and UNK-919 him to think that he would never be UNK-423 from it 
 UNK-571 however UNK-797 he might live or whatever UNK-51 or UNK-341 
 he might UNK-199 . a UNK-741 feeling of UNK-824 would always be present 
 with him he would UNK-313 and UNK-350 and be UNK-182 UNK-313 and 
 UNK-350 again and be UNK-182 again UNK-946 . perhaps that first 
 UNK-476 UNK-343 UNK-645 from him by the fear of hell had not been good ? 
 perhaps concerned only for his UNK-468 doom he had not had UNK-63 
 UNK-234 for his sin ? but the UNK-338 sign that his UNK-343 had been 
 good and that he had had UNK-63 UNK-234 for his sin was he knew the 
 amendment of his life . 
 UNK-0 
 i have amended my life have i not ? he asked himself .

 the director stood in the UNK-100 of the window his back to the 
 light UNK-200 an UNK-213 on the brown UNK-598 and as he spoke and 
 UNK-24 slowly UNK-787 and UNK-157 the cord of the other blind 
 stephen stood before him following for a moment with his eyes the 
 UNK-492 of the long summer UNK-917 above the UNK-170 or the slow UNK-529 
 movements of the UNK-766 fingers . the UNK-73 face was in total 
 shadow but the UNK-492 UNK-917 from behind him touched the deeply 
 UNK-382 UNK-97 and the curves of the UNK-241 . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen followed also with his ears the UNK-122 and intervals of the 
 UNK-73 voice as he spoke UNK-141 and UNK-698 of UNK-942 themes 
 the vacation which had just ended the colleges of the order abroad 
 the UNK-620 of masters . the grave and UNK-107 voice went on easily 
 with its tale and in the UNK-446 stephen felt bound to set it on again 
 with UNK-202 questions . he knew that the tale was a UNK-264 and his 
 mind UNK-56 for the UNK-299 . ever since the message of UNK-913 had come 
 for him from the director his mind had UNK-250 to find the meaning of 
 the message and during the long UNK-741 time he had sat in the 
 college UNK-309 waiting for the director to come in his eyes had 
 UNK-326 from one UNK-357 picture to another around the walls and his 
 mind UNK-326 from one guess to another until the meaning of the 
 UNK-913 had almost become clear . then just as he was wishing that some 
 UNK-842 cause might prevent the director from coming he had heard 
 the handle of the door turning and the UNK-430 of a UNK-825 . 
 UNK-0 
 the director had begun to speak of the dominican and UNK-369 orders 
 and of the friendship between saint thomas and saint UNK-188 . the 
 UNK-252 dress he thought was rather too . . . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-8 face gave back the UNK-73 UNK-366 smile and not being 
 UNK-860 to give an opinion he made a slight UNK-358 movement with 
 his lips . 
 UNK-0 
 i believe continued the director that there is some talk now among 
 the UNK-375 themselves of doing away with it and following the 
 example of the other UNK-518 . 
 UNK-0 
 i suppose they would retain it in the UNK-702 ? said stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 o certainly said the director . for the UNK-308 it is all right but 
 for the street i really think it would be better to do away with it 
 dont you ? 
 UNK-0 
 it must be UNK-880 i imagine . 
 UNK-0 
 of course it is of course . just imagine when i was in belgium i 
 used to see them out cycling in all kinds of weather with this thing up 
 about their UNK-111 ! it was really UNK-684 . les UNK-256 they call them 
 in belgium . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-864 was so modified as to be UNK-398 . 
 UNK-0 
 what do they call them ? 
 UNK-0 
 les UNK-256 . 
 UNK-0 
 o ! 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-24 again in answer to the smile which he could not see on 
 the UNK-73 UNK-932 face its image or UNK-742 only passing rapidly 
 across his mind as the low UNK-317 accent fell upon his ear . he UNK-84 
 UNK-331 before him at the UNK-492 sky glad of the cool of the evening 
 and of the UNK-90 yellow glow which UNK-373 the tiny flame UNK-328 upon his 
 UNK-139 . 
 UNK-0 
 the names of articles of dress worn by women or of certain soft and 
 UNK-325 UNK-351 used in their making brought always to his mind a 
 UNK-325 and UNK-578 perfume . as a boy he had UNK-747 the UNK-730 by 
 which horses are driven as UNK-293 UNK-376 bands and it UNK-312 him to 
 feel at UNK-570 the UNK-830 leather of UNK-310 . it had UNK-312 him 
 too when he had felt for the first time beneath his UNK-993 fingers 
 the UNK-14 texture of a UNK-95 UNK-261 for UNK-129 nothing of all 
 he read save that which seemed to him an echo or a UNK-195 of his own 
 state it was only UNK-22 UNK-205 phrases or within UNK-340 UNK-351 
 that he UNK-357 to UNK-131 of the soul or body of a woman moving with 
 tender life . 
 UNK-0 
 but the phrase on the UNK-73 lips was UNK-470 for he knew that a 
 priest should not speak UNK-79 on that theme . the phrase had been 
 spoken UNK-79 with design and he felt that his face was being searched 
 by the eyes in the shadow . whatever he had heard or read of the craft 
 of UNK-517 he had put aside UNK-846 as not UNK-618 out by his own 
 experience . his masters even when they had not UNK-57 him 
 had seemed to him always intelligent and serious UNK-73 
 athletic and UNK-116 UNK-881 . he thought of them as men 
 who UNK-466 their bodies UNK-587 with cold water and UNK-71 clean cold 
 UNK-683 . during all the years he had lived among them in UNK-202 and in 
 UNK-928 he had received only two UNK-438 and though these had been 
 dealt him in the wrong he knew that he had often UNK-525 punishment . 
 during all those years he had never heard from any of his masters a 
 UNK-962 word it was they who had taught him christian doctrine and 
 UNK-318 him to live a good life and when he had fallen into UNK-137 
 sin it was they who had led him back to grace . their presence had made 
 him UNK-218 of himself when he was a UNK-621 in UNK-202 and it had made 
 him UNK-218 of himself also while he had held his UNK-603 position 
 in UNK-928 . a constant sense of this had remained with him up to the 
 last year of his school life . he had never once UNK-366 or allowed 
 UNK-617 UNK-193 to UNK-8 him from his UNK-158 of quiet UNK-268 
 and even when he UNK-37 some statement of a master he had never 
 UNK-714 to doubt UNK-182 . lately some of their UNK-135 had UNK-224 a 
 little UNK-191 in his ears and had made him feel a UNK-675 and UNK-47 as 
 though he were slowly passing out of an UNK-354 world and were 
 hearing its language for the last time . one day when some boys had 
 gathered round a priest under the shed near the chapel he had heard 
 the priest say 
 UNK-0 
 i believe that lord UNK-640 was a man who probably never committed 
 a UNK-235 sin in his life that is to say a UNK-781 UNK-235 sin . 
 UNK-0 
 some of the boys had then asked the priest if victor hugo were not the 
 greatest french writer . the priest had answered that victor hugo had 
 never written half so well when he had turned against the church as he 
 had written when he was a catholic . 
 UNK-0 
 but there are many UNK-926 french critics said the priest who 
 consider that even victor hugo great as he certainly was had not so 
 pure a french style as louis UNK-499 . 
 UNK-0 
 the tiny flame which the UNK-73 UNK-858 had UNK-537 upon UNK-8 
 UNK-139 had UNK-796 down again and his eyes were still fixed UNK-331 on the 
 UNK-850 sky . but an UNK-583 doubt UNK-230 UNK-763 and UNK-467 before 
 his mind . UNK-178 memories passed quickly before him he recognized 
 scenes and persons yet he was conscious that he had failed to UNK-680 
 some vital UNK-194 in them . he saw himself walking about the 
 grounds watching the sports in UNK-202 and eating slim jim out of his 
 cricket cap . some UNK-517 were walking round the UNK-690 in the 
 company of ladies . the UNK-691 of certain expressions used in UNK-202 
 UNK-224 in remote UNK-394 of his mind . 
 UNK-0 
 his ears were listening to these distant UNK-691 UNK-22 the silence of the 
 UNK-309 when he became aware that the priest was addressing him in a 
 different voice . 
 UNK-0 
 i sent for you today stephen because i UNK-136 to speak to you on a 
 very important subject . 
 UNK-0 
 yes sir . 
 UNK-0 
 have you ever felt that you had a UNK-765 ? 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-621 his lips to answer yes and then UNK-454 the word 
 suddenly . the priest UNK-56 for the answer and added 
 UNK-0 
 i mean have you ever felt within yourself in your soul a desire 
 to join the order ? think . 
 UNK-0 
 i have sometimes thought of it said stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 the priest let the UNK-212 fall to one side and UNK-563 his hands 
 UNK-122 his UNK-333 UNK-141 upon them UNK-440 with himself . 
 UNK-0 
 in a college like this he said at length there is one boy or perhaps 
 two or three boys whom god calls to the religious life . such a boy is 
 marked off from his UNK-193 by his UNK-101 by the good example he 
 shows to others . he is looked up to by them he is chosen perhaps as 
 UNK-89 by his fellow UNK-547 . and you stephen have been such a boy 
 in this college UNK-89 of our blessed UNK-532 UNK-173 . perhaps you 
 are the boy in this college whom god designs to call to himself . 
 UNK-0 
 a strong note of pride UNK-811 the gravity of the UNK-73 voice 
 made UNK-8 heart UNK-257 in response . 
 UNK-0 
 to receive that call stephen said the priest is the greatest UNK-88 
 that the UNK-783 god can UNK-359 upon a man . no king or emperor on this 
 earth has the power of the priest of god . no angel or UNK-260 in 
 heaven no saint not even the blessed virgin herself has the power of 
 a priest of god the power of the keys the power to bind and to loose 
 from sin the power of UNK-256 the power to cast out from the 
 creatures of god the evil spirits that have power over them the power 
 the authority to make the great god of heaven come down upon the UNK-92 
 and take the form of bread and wine . what an awful power stephen ! 
 UNK-0 
 a flame began to UNK-782 again on UNK-8 UNK-139 as he heard in this 
 proud address an echo of his own proud UNK-14 . how often had he seen 
 himself as a priest UNK-856 UNK-331 and UNK-970 the awful power 
 of which angels and saints stood in UNK-510 ! his soul had loved 
 to UNK-550 in secret on this desire . he had seen himself a young 
 and UNK-291 priest entering a UNK-948 UNK-171 
 UNK-463 the UNK-772 UNK-567 UNK-179 UNK-621 
 the UNK-209 acts of the UNK-117 which pleased him by reason of 
 their UNK-245 of reality and of their distance from it . in that 
 dim life which he had lived through in his UNK-14 he had 
 assumed the voices and UNK-746 which he had noted with various 
 UNK-73 . he had bent his knee UNK-174 like such a one he had 
 UNK-491 the UNK-836 only slightly like such a one his UNK-162 had 
 UNK-414 open like that of such another as he turned to the UNK-92 again 
 after having blessed the people . and above all it had pleased him to 
 fill the second place in those dim scenes of his UNK-316 . he UNK-680 
 from the UNK-491 of UNK-947 because it UNK-494 him to imagine that 
 all the UNK-209 UNK-93 should end in his own person or that the UNK-118 
 should assign to him so clear and final an office . he UNK-405 for the 
 minor sacred offices to be UNK-534 with the UNK-640 of UNK-600 at 
 high mass to stand UNK-293 from the UNK-92 forgotten by the people his 
 UNK-61 covered with a UNK-571 UNK-296 holding the UNK-567 within its 
 UNK-47 or when the sacrifice had been accomplished to stand as UNK-647 
 in a UNK-859 of cloth of gold on the step below the UNK-947 his 
 hands joined and his face towards the people and sing the UNK-223 UNK-622 
 UNK-1 est . if ever he had seen himself UNK-947 it was as in the 
 pictures of the mass in his UNK-337 UNK-139 in a church without 
 UNK-903 save for the angel of the sacrifice at a bare UNK-92 and 
 served by an UNK-497 UNK-253 more UNK-848 than himself . in UNK-209 
 UNK-199 or UNK-318 acts alone his will seemed drawn to go forth 
 to encounter reality and it was partly the absence of an appointed 
 UNK-11 which had always UNK-433 him to UNK-185 whether he had 
 allowed silence to cover his anger or pride or had suffered only an 
 UNK-73 he UNK-405 to give . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-126 in UNK-585 silence now to the UNK-73 appeal and through 
 the words he heard even more UNK-589 a voice bidding him approach 
 offering him secret knowledge and secret power . he would know then what 
 was the sin of simon UNK-244 and what the sin against the holy ghost for 
 which there was no UNK-258 . he would know UNK-960 things hidden 
 from others from those who were UNK-290 and born children of UNK-880 . 
 he would know the UNK-104 the UNK-578 UNK-102 and UNK-578 thoughts and 
 UNK-578 acts of others hearing them UNK-203 into his ears in the 
 UNK-948 under the shame of a UNK-554 chapel by the lips of women 
 and of girls but rendered immune UNK-930 at his UNK-331 by the 
 UNK-325 of hands his soul would pass again UNK-355 to the 
 white peace of the UNK-92 . no touch of sin would UNK-552 upon the hands 
 with which he would UNK-627 and break the host no touch of sin would 
 UNK-552 on his lips in prayer to make him eat and drink UNK-414 to 
 himself not UNK-101 the body of the lord . he would hold his secret 
 knowledge and secret power being as UNK-422 as the innocent and he 
 would be a priest for ever according to the order of UNK-978 . 
 UNK-0 
 i will offer up my mass tomorrow morning said the director that 
 UNK-783 god may reveal to you his holy will . and let you stephen 
 make a UNK-53 to your holy UNK-186 saint the first UNK-484 who is very 
 powerful with god that god may UNK-75 your mind . but you must be 
 quite sure stephen that you have a UNK-765 because it would be 
 terrible if you found afterwards that you had none . once a priest 
 always a priest remember . your UNK-694 tells you that the UNK-511 
 of holy orders is one of those which can be received only once because 
 it UNK-329 on the soul an UNK-173 spiritual mark which can never be 
 UNK-596 . it is before you must UNK-737 well not after . it is a UNK-384 
 question stephen because on it may depend the salvation of your 
 eternal soul . but we will pray to god together . 
 UNK-0 
 he held open the heavy hall door and gave his hand as if already to a 
 companion in the spiritual life . stephen passed out on to the wide 
 platform above the steps and was conscious of the UNK-806 of mild 
 evening air . towards UNK-131 church a UNK-46 of young men were 
 UNK-122 along with linked arms UNK-223 their heads and UNK-764 to 
 the UNK-386 UNK-922 of their leaders UNK-609 . the music passed in an 
 instant as the first bars of sudden music always did over the 
 fantastic fabrics of his mind UNK-596 them UNK-169 and 
 UNK-963 as a sudden wave UNK-393 the UNK-588 UNK-130 of 
 children . UNK-21 at the UNK-168 air he raised his eyes to the UNK-73 
 face and seeing in it a UNK-909 reflection of the UNK-667 day 
 UNK-489 his hand slowly which had UNK-449 UNK-284 in the 
 UNK-678 . 
 UNK-0 
 as he UNK-244 the steps the impression which UNK-596 his UNK-371 
 UNK-907 was that of a UNK-909 mask UNK-143 a UNK-667 day 
 from the threshold of the college . the shadow then of the life of the 
 college passed UNK-141 over his consciousness . it was a grave and 
 ordered and UNK-517 life that UNK-864 him a life without material 
 UNK-89 . he UNK-105 how he would pass the first night in the UNK-153 
 and with what UNK-319 he would wake the first morning in the UNK-773 . 
 the UNK-863 UNK-143 of the long UNK-158 of UNK-202 came back to him 
 and he heard the UNK-317 UNK-208 of the burning UNK-908 . at once from 
 every part of his being UNK-927 began to UNK-845 . a UNK-493 
 UNK-197 of his UNK-18 followed and a UNK-595 of UNK-159 words drove 
 his UNK-457 thoughts UNK-763 and UNK-467 UNK-640 . his UNK-277 UNK-354 
 and UNK-443 as if he were UNK-369 a warm UNK-295 UNK-125 air and he 
 UNK-616 again the UNK-295 warm air which hung in the bath in UNK-202 
 above the UNK-336 UNK-451 water . 
 UNK-0 
 some UNK-375 UNK-632 at these memories stronger than education or 
 UNK-101 UNK-360 within him at every near approach to that life an 
 UNK-375 subtle and UNK-719 and armed him against UNK-828 . the 
 UNK-915 and order of the life UNK-457 him . he saw himself rising in the 
 cold of the morning and filing down with the others to early mass and 
 trying UNK-501 to struggle with his prayers against the UNK-215 
 UNK-309 of his stomach . he saw himself sitting at dinner with the 
 community of a college . what then had become of that UNK-678 
 UNK-787 of his which had made him UNK-426 to eat or drink under a strange 
 roof ? what had come of the pride of his spirit which had always made 
 him UNK-131 himself as a being apart in every order ? 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-140 stephen UNK-1 s UNK-467 . 
 UNK-0 
 his name in that new life UNK-714 into characters before his eyes and to 
 it there followed a mental UNK-393 of an undefined face or colour of 
 a face . the colour UNK-238 and became strong like a changing glow of 
 UNK-13 brick red . was it the raw UNK-694 glow he had so often seen on 
 UNK-646 UNK-521 on the UNK-679 UNK-322 of the UNK-73 ? the face was 
 UNK-535 and UNK-383 and UNK-636 shot with pink UNK-285 of 
 UNK-982 anger . was it not a mental UNK-742 of the face of one of the 
 UNK-517 whom some of the boys called UNK-504 UNK-968 and others UNK-742 
 campbell ? 
 UNK-0 
 he was passing at that moment before the UNK-249 house in UNK-914 
 street and UNK-105 UNK-489 which window would be his if he ever joined 
 the order . then he UNK-105 at the UNK-149 of his wonder at the 
 UNK-131 of his own soul from what he had UNK-282 UNK-747 her 
 UNK-55 at the UNK-422 hold which so many years of order and UNK-268 
 had of him when once a UNK-861 and UNK-195 act of his threatened 
 to end for ever in time and in UNK-162 his freedom . the voice of the 
 director UNK-293 upon him the proud claims of the church and the mystery 
 and power of the UNK-766 office repeated itself UNK-864 in his memory . 
 his soul was not there to hear and UNK-366 it and he knew now that the 
 UNK-956 he had UNK-126 to had already fallen into an idle formal 
 tale . he would never swing the UNK-836 before the UNK-601 as priest . 
 his destiny was to be UNK-241 of social or religious orders . the wisdom of 
 the UNK-73 appeal did not touch him to the quick . he was UNK-81 to 
 learn his own wisdom apart from others or to learn the wisdom of others 
 himself UNK-254 among the UNK-175 of the world . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-175 of the world were its ways of sin . he would fall . he had not 
 yet fallen but he would fall UNK-173 in an instant . not to fall was 
 too hard too hard and he felt the silent UNK-378 of his soul as it 
 would be at some instant to come falling falling but not yet fallen 
 still UNK-823 but about to fall . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-112 the bridge over the stream of the UNK-27 and turned his eyes 
 UNK-482 for an instant towards the UNK-238 blue UNK-366 of the blessed 
 virgin which stood UNK-953 on a pole in the middle of a UNK-778 
 UNK-500 of poor cottages . then UNK-277 to the left he followed the 
 lane which led up to his house . the UNK-90 UNK-878 UNK-3 of UNK-463 UNK-723 
 came towards him from the kitchen gardens on the rising ground above 
 the river . he UNK-24 to think that it was this disorder the UNK-148 
 and confusion of his fathers house and the UNK-659 of vegetable 
 life which was to win the day in his soul . then a short laugh broke 
 from his lips as he thought of that UNK-946 UNK-362 in the kitchen 
 gardens behind their house whom they had UNK-308 the man with the 
 hat . a second laugh taking rise from the first after a UNK-242 broke 
 from him UNK-594 as he thought of how the man with the hat 
 worked considering in turn the four points of the sky and then 
 UNK-729 UNK-655 his UNK-917 in the earth . 
 UNK-0 
 he pushed open the UNK-274 door of the UNK-372 and passed through the 
 naked UNK-996 into the kitchen . a group of his brothers and sisters was 
 sitting round the table . tea was nearly over and only the last of the 
 second UNK-658 tea remained in the UNK-379 of the small glass UNK-146 and 
 UNK-815 which did service for UNK-825 . UNK-569 UNK-483 and UNK-882 of 
 UNK-708 bread turned brown by the tea which had been UNK-207 over them 
 lay UNK-824 on the table . little wells of tea lay here and there on 
 the board and a knife with a broken ivory handle was stuck through the 
 UNK-532 of a UNK-397 UNK-826 . 
 UNK-0 
 the sad quiet UNK-452 glow of the dying day came through the window 
 and the open door covering over and UNK-810 UNK-40 a sudden UNK-375 
 of UNK-246 in UNK-8 heart . all that had been denied them had been 
 freely given to him the UNK-904 but the quiet glow of evening showed 
 him in their faces no sign of UNK-87 . 
 UNK-0 
 he sat near them at the table and asked where his father and mother 
 were . one answered 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-90 UNK-149 UNK-130 UNK-10 UNK-956 UNK-924 . 
 UNK-0 
 still another removal ! a boy named UNK-114 in UNK-928 had often asked 
 him with a silly laugh why they moved so often . a UNK-907 of UNK-589 
 UNK-554 quickly his UNK-133 as he heard again the silly laugh of the 
 UNK-10 . 
 UNK-0 
 he asked 
 UNK-0 
 why are we on the move again if its a fair question ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-97 UNK-367 UNK-182 UNK-32 UNK-913 UNK-622 UNK-777 UNK-379 . 
 UNK-0 
 the voice of his UNK-55 brother from the UNK-199 side of the 
 fireplace began to sing the air UNK-226 in the UNK-225 night . one by one the 
 others took up the air until a full choir of voices was singing . they 
 would sing so for hours UNK-922 after UNK-922 UNK-401 after UNK-401 till the 
 last pale light died down on the horizon till the first dark night 
 clouds came forth and night fell . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-56 for some moments listening before he too took up the air 
 with them . he was listening with pain of spirit to the UNK-71 of 
 UNK-890 behind their UNK-422 fresh innocent voices . even before they 
 set out on UNK-667 journey they seemed UNK-129 already of the way . 
 UNK-0 
 he heard the choir of voices in the kitchen UNK-131 and UNK-133 
 through an endless UNK-519 of the UNK-77 of endless generations 
 of children and heard in all the UNK-691 an echo also of the UNK-701 
 note of UNK-890 and pain . all seemed UNK-129 of life even before 
 entering upon it . and he remembered that newman had heard this note 
 also in the broken lines of UNK-907 giving UNK-652 like the voice of 
 nature herself to that pain and UNK-890 yet hope of better things 
 which has been the experience of her children in every time . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 he could wait no longer . 
 UNK-0 
 from the door of UNK-884 UNK-722 to the gate of UNK-680 chapel 
 from the gate of UNK-158 chapel to the door of UNK-884 UNK-722 
 and then back again to the chapel and then back again to the UNK-722 
 he had UNK-771 slowly at first UNK-862 his steps UNK-19 in 
 the spaces of the UNK-324 of the UNK-125 then timing their fall to 
 the fall of UNK-351 . a full hour had passed since his father had gone in 
 with dan UNK-465 the UNK-354 to find out for him something about the 
 university . for a full hour he had UNK-771 up and down waiting but he 
 could wait no longer . 
 UNK-0 
 he set off UNK-740 for the bull walking rapidly UNK-689 his fathers 
 UNK-367 UNK-266 might call him back and in a few moments he had UNK-630 
 the curve at the police UNK-90 and was safe . 
 UNK-0 
 yes his mother was UNK-719 to the idea as he had read from her 
 UNK-826 silence . yet her UNK-707 UNK-202 him more UNK-345 than his 
 fathers pride and he thought UNK-482 how he had watched the faith which 
 was UNK-546 down in his soul UNK-969 and strengthening in her eyes . a dim 
 UNK-981 gathered force within him and UNK-554 his mind as a cloud 
 against her UNK-544 and when it passed UNK-190 leaving his mind 
 UNK-587 and UNK-620 towards her again he was made aware UNK-815 and 
 without UNK-675 of a first UNK-85 UNK-457 of their lives . 
 UNK-0 
 the university ! so he had passed beyond the challenge of the UNK-922 
 who had stood as UNK-586 of his UNK-492 and had sought to keep him 
 among them that he might be subject to them and serve their ends . pride 
 after satisfaction UNK-387 him like long slow waves . the end he had 
 been born to serve yet did not see had led him to escape by an UNK-768 
 path and now it UNK-53 to him once more and a new adventure was about 
 to be opened to him . it seemed to him that he heard notes of UNK-780 
 music UNK-410 UNK-356 a tone and UNK-484 a UNK-443 fourth UNK-356 
 a tone and UNK-484 a major third like UNK-701 UNK-709 
 UNK-410 UNK-557 flame after flame out of a midnight wood . it was an 
 UNK-85 UNK-264 endless and UNK-806 and as it grew UNK-661 and faster 
 the UNK-709 UNK-410 out of time he seemed to hear from under the UNK-103 
 and UNK-615 wild creatures racing their feet UNK-908 like rain upon 
 the leaves . their feet passed in UNK-908 UNK-906 over his mind the 
 feet of UNK-222 and UNK-682 the feet of UNK-694 and UNK-807 and UNK-318 
 until he heard them no more and remembered only a proud UNK-435 from 
 newman 
 UNK-0 
 whose feet are as the feet of UNK-694 and UNK-733 the UNK-417 arms . 
 UNK-0 
 the pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the UNK-491 of the 
 office he had refused . all through his UNK-492 he had UNK-486 upon that 
 which he had so often thought to be his destiny and when the moment had 
 come for him to UNK-823 the call he had turned aside UNK-107 a UNK-752 
 UNK-375 . now time lay between the oils of UNK-331 would never 
 UNK-737 his body . he had refused . why ? 
 UNK-0 
 he turned UNK-55 from the road at UNK-675 and as he passed on to 
 the thin wooden bridge he felt the UNK-491 UNK-144 with the UNK-302 of 
 heavily UNK-679 feet . a squad of christian brothers was on its way back 
 from the bull and had begun to pass two by two across the bridge . 
 soon the whole bridge was UNK-178 and UNK-403 . the UNK-576 faces 
 passed him two by two UNK-567 yellow or red or UNK-460 by the sea and 
 as he UNK-952 to look at them with ease and UNK-506 a UNK-90 UNK-103 
 of personal shame and UNK-485 rose to his own face . angry with 
 himself he tried to hide his face from their eyes by UNK-248 down 
 UNK-174 into the UNK-502 UNK-704 water under the bridge but he still 
 saw a reflection UNK-343 of their UNK-321 silk hats and UNK-369 
 UNK-125 UNK-184 and UNK-829 UNK-490 clothes . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  brother UNK-976 . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  brother UNK-589 . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  brother UNK-270 . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  brother UNK-38 . 
 UNK-0 
 their UNK-101 would be like their names like their faces like their 
 clothes and it was idle for him to tell himself that their UNK-369 and 
 UNK-638 hearts it might be paid a far UNK-280 tribute of UNK-796 
 than his had ever been a gift UNK-484 more acceptable than his 
 UNK-896 UNK-111 . it was idle for him to move himself to be generous 
 towards them to tell himself that if he ever came to their gates 
 UNK-627 of his pride UNK-309 and in UNK-228 UNK-861 that they would be 
 generous towards him loving him as themselves . idle and UNK-989 
 finally to argue against his own UNK-452 UNK-50 that the 
 UNK-858 of love UNK-432 us not to love our UNK-379 as ourselves with 
 the same amount and intensity of love but to love him as ourselves with 
 the same kind of love . 
 UNK-0 
 he drew forth a phrase from his treasure and spoke it UNK-41 to 
 himself 
 UNK-0 
 a day of UNK-63 UNK-723 clouds . 
 UNK-0 
 the phrase and the day and the scene UNK-780 in a UNK-774 . words . was 
 it their colours ? he allowed them to glow and UNK-247 UNK-641 after UNK-641 
 sunrise gold the UNK-305 and green of apple UNK-793 UNK-796 of waves 
 the UNK-911 fleece of clouds . no it was not their colours it was 
 the UNK-60 and balance of the period itself . did he then love the 
 UNK-109 rise and fall of words better than their associations of 
 legend and colour ? or was it that being as weak of sight as he was UNK-523 
 of mind he drew less pleasure from the reflection of the UNK-808 
 UNK-629 world through the UNK-208 of a language UNK-34 and UNK-861 
 UNK-291 than from the UNK-481 of an inner world of individual 
 emotions UNK-828 perfectly in a UNK-804 UNK-823 periodic UNK-312 ? 
 UNK-0 
 he passed from the UNK-178 bridge on to firm land again . at that 
 instant as it seemed to him the air was UNK-35 and looking UNK-888 
 towards the water he saw a flying UNK-829 UNK-3 and UNK-215 
 suddenly the tide . a UNK-90 click at his heart a UNK-90 UNK-233 in his 
 throat told him once more of how his flesh UNK-779 the cold UNK-272 
 UNK-143 of the sea yet he did not strike across the UNK-709 on his left 
 but held straight on along the spine of rocks that pointed against the 
 rivers mouth . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-585 UNK-252 lit up UNK-284 the grey sheet of water where the 
 river was UNK-618 . in the distance along the course of the UNK-839 
 UNK-564 UNK-293 UNK-561 UNK-290 the sky and more distant still the dim 
 fabric of the city lay UNK-805 in UNK-704 . like a scene on some UNK-209 UNK-204 
 old as UNK-54 UNK-890 the image of the seventh city of UNK-336 
 was visible to him across the UNK-802 air no older nor more UNK-129 nor 
 less patient of UNK-932 than in the days of the UNK-351 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-843 he raised his eyes towards the UNK-805 clouds 
 UNK-63 and UNK-723 . they were UNK-710 across the UNK-251 of the sky 
 a host of UNK-939 on the march UNK-710 high over ireland UNK-501 
 bound . the europe they had come from lay out there beyond the irish 
 sea europe of strange UNK-591 and UNK-158 and UNK-167 and 
 UNK-855 and of UNK-555 and UNK-717 races . he heard a confused 
 music within him as of memories and names which he was almost conscious 
 of but could not capture even for an instant then the music seemed to 
 UNK-264 to UNK-264 to UNK-264 and from each UNK-229 trail of UNK-302 
 music there fell always one UNK-80 calling note UNK-533 like a 
 star the UNK-322 of silence . again ! again ! again ! a voice from beyond the 
 world was calling . 
 UNK-0 
 hello UNK-427 ! 
 UNK-0 
 here comes the UNK-1 ! 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-26 ! . . . eh give it over UNK-495 im telling you or ill give you a stuff 
 in the UNK-344 for yourself . . . UNK-26 !

 UNK-0 
 duck him ! UNK-139 him now UNK-743 ! 
 UNK-0 
 help ! help ! . . . UNK-26 ! 
 UNK-0 
 he recognized their speech UNK-624 before he distinguished their 
 faces . the mere sight of that UNK-577 of wet UNK-324 UNK-35 him to 
 the bone . their bodies UNK-930 or UNK-197 with a UNK-13 golden 
 light or UNK-637 UNK-58 by the sun UNK-834 with the wet of the sea . 
 their UNK-235 UNK-834 on its UNK-292 supports and UNK-147 under their 
 UNK-819 and the UNK-347 stones of the UNK-576 UNK-589 over which 
 they UNK-217 in their UNK-329 UNK-834 with cold wet UNK-341 . the 
 UNK-84 with which they UNK-684 their bodies were heavy with cold 
 UNK-475 and UNK-952 with cold UNK-609 was their UNK-353 hair . 
 UNK-0 
 he stood still in UNK-269 to their calls and UNK-638 their UNK-388 
 with easy words . how UNK-196 they looked UNK-918 without his deep 
 UNK-132 collar UNK-844 without his UNK-205 belt with the UNK-476 UNK-557 
 and UNK-196 without his norfolk coat with the UNK-331 UNK-781 ! 
 it was a pain to see them and a UNK-870 pain to see the signs of 
 UNK-420 that made UNK-62 their UNK-944 UNK-324 . perhaps they 
 had taken UNK-324 in number and noise from the secret UNK-230 in their 
 souls . but he apart from them and in silence remembered in what UNK-230 
 he stood of the mystery of his own body . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-427 UNK-684 ! UNK-412 UNK-259 ! UNK-412 UNK-517 ! 
 UNK-0 
 their UNK-388 was not new to him and now it UNK-160 his mild proud 
 UNK-466 . now as never before his strange name seemed to him a 
 UNK-195 . so UNK-802 seemed the grey warm air so fluid and UNK-886 
 his own mood that all ages were as one to him . a moment before the 
 ghost of the ancient kingdom of the UNK-569 had looked forth through the 
 UNK-585 of the UNK-304 city . now at the name of the fabulous 
 UNK-323 he seemed to hear the noise of dim waves and to see a UNK-663 
 form flying above the waves and slowly climbing the air . what did it 
 mean ? was it a UNK-495 device opening a page of some medieval book of 
 UNK-386 and symbols a UNK-712 man flying UNK-735 above the sea a 
 UNK-195 of the end he had been born to serve and had been following 
 through the UNK-683 of childhood and UNK-492 a symbol of the artist 
 UNK-21 UNK-772 in his workshop out of the UNK-336 matter of the earth a 
 new UNK-509 UNK-378 UNK-846 being ? 
 UNK-0 
 his heart UNK-515 his breath came faster and a wild spirit passed 
 over his UNK-477 as though he was UNK-509 UNK-735 . his heart UNK-515 in 
 an UNK-119 of fear and his soul was in flight . his soul was UNK-509 in 
 an air beyond the world and the body he knew was UNK-402 in a breath 
 and delivered of UNK-723 and made UNK-543 and UNK-478 with the 
 element of the spirit . an UNK-119 of flight made UNK-543 his eyes and 
 wild his breath and UNK-993 and wild and UNK-543 his UNK-565 UNK-477 . 
 UNK-0 
 one ! two ! . . . look out ! 
 UNK-0 
 oh UNK-942 im UNK-873 ! 
 UNK-0 
 one ! two ! three and away ! 
 UNK-0 
 the next ! the next ! 
 UNK-0

 UNK-517 ! 
 UNK-0 
 his throat UNK-183 with a desire to cry UNK-736 the cry of a hawk or eagle 
 on high to cry UNK-266 of his UNK-198 to the winds . this was 
 the call of life to his soul not the UNK-66 gross voice of the world of 
 duties and UNK-85 not the UNK-504 voice that had called him to the 
 pale service of the UNK-92 . an instant of wild flight had delivered him 
 and the cry of triumph which his lips UNK-454 UNK-841 his brain . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-517 ! 
 UNK-0 
 what were they now but UNK-584 UNK-491 from the body of UNK-893 
 fear he had walked in night and day the UNK-723 that had UNK-17 
 him round the shame that had UNK-670 him within and UNK-122 
 the UNK-680 of the grave ? 
 UNK-0 
 his soul had UNK-149 from the grave of UNK-492 UNK-921 her 
 UNK-885 . yes ! yes ! yes ! he would create proudly out of the 
 freedom and power of his soul as the great UNK-323 whose name he 
 UNK-135 a living thing new and UNK-509 and beautiful UNK-378 
 UNK-846 . 
 UNK-0 
 he started up UNK-409 from the UNK-810 for he could no longer 
 UNK-126 the flame in his blood . he felt his UNK-145 UNK-170 and his throat 
 UNK-316 with song . there was a UNK-431 of UNK-254 in his feet that 
 UNK-416 to set out for the ends of the earth . on ! on ! his heart seemed 
 to cry . evening would UNK-544 above the sea night fall upon the plains 
 dawn UNK-133 before the UNK-174 and show him strange fields and hills 
 and faces . where ? 
 UNK-0 
 he looked UNK-973 towards UNK-301 . the sea had fallen below the line of 
 UNK-877 on the UNK-502 side of the UNK-589 and already the tide was 
 running out fast along the UNK-408 . already one long oval bank of 
 sand lay warm and dry UNK-22 the UNK-81 . here and there warm UNK-321 of 
 sand UNK-834 above the UNK-502 tide and about the UNK-321 and around the 
 long bank and UNK-22 the UNK-502 UNK-481 of the beach were UNK-37 
 figures UNK-850 and UNK-446 . 
 UNK-0 
 in a few moments he was UNK-408 his stockings UNK-177 in his pockets 
 and his canvas shoes UNK-787 by their UNK-253 UNK-869 over his UNK-61 
 and picking a pointed UNK-966 stick out of the UNK-192 among the 
 rocks he UNK-655 down the slope of the UNK-589 . 
 UNK-0 
 there was a long UNK-816 in the strand and as he UNK-889 slowly up its 
 course he UNK-105 at the endless UNK-230 of UNK-638 . emerald and black 
 and UNK-305 and olive it moved beneath the current UNK-223 and 
 turning . the water of the UNK-816 was dark with endless UNK-230 and 
 UNK-828 the UNK-282 clouds . the clouds were UNK-897 above him 
 UNK-173 and UNK-173 the UNK-875 was UNK-897 below him and the grey 
 warm air was still and a new wild life was singing in his UNK-692 . 
 UNK-0 
 where was his UNK-492 now ? where was the soul that had hung back from 
 her destiny to UNK-771 alone upon the shame of her UNK-20 and in her 
 house of UNK-499 and UNK-120 to queen it in UNK-238 UNK-584 and in 
 UNK-690 that UNK-821 at the touch ? or where was he ? 
 UNK-0 
 he was alone . he was UNK-451 happy and near to the wild heart of 
 life . he was alone and young and UNK-20 and UNK-199 alone UNK-22 a 
 waste of wild air and UNK-151 waters and the UNK-793 of UNK-559 and 
 UNK-845 and UNK-585 grey UNK-252 and UNK-604 UNK-37 figures of 
 children and girls and voices UNK-191 and UNK-175 in the air . 
 UNK-0 
 a girl stood before him in UNK-708 alone and still UNK-248 out to 
 sea . she seemed like one whom magic had changed into the UNK-282 of a 
 strange and beautiful UNK-89 . her long UNK-293 bare legs were UNK-325 
 as a UNK-312 and pure save where an emerald trail of UNK-638 had 
 UNK-791 itself as a sign upon the flesh . her UNK-932 UNK-913 and 
 UNK-197 as ivory were UNK-336 almost to the UNK-40 where the white 
 UNK-165 of her UNK-440 were like UNK-336 of soft white down . her 
 UNK-854 skirts were UNK-800 UNK-258 about her UNK-599 and UNK-748 
 behind her . her UNK-186 was as a birds soft and slight slight and soft 
 as the breast of some UNK-669 UNK-127 . but her long fair hair was 
 UNK-175 and UNK-175 and touched with the wonder of UNK-235 beauty her 
 face . 
 UNK-0 
 she was alone and still UNK-248 out to sea and when she felt his 
 presence and the worship of his eyes her eyes turned to him in quiet 
 UNK-90 of his UNK-49 without shame or UNK-407 . long long she 
 suffered his UNK-49 and then UNK-40 UNK-740 her eyes from his and bent 
 them towards the stream gently UNK-716 the water with her foot UNK-763 
 and UNK-467 . the first UNK-90 noise of gently moving water broke the 
 silence low and UNK-90 and UNK-387 UNK-90 as the UNK-215 of sleep 
 UNK-763 and UNK-467 UNK-763 and UNK-467 and a UNK-90 flame UNK-515 on 
 her UNK-139 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-198 god ! UNK-5 UNK-8 soul in an UNK-256 of UNK-824 joy . 
 UNK-0 
 he turned away from her suddenly and set off across the strand . his 
 UNK-145 were UNK-170 his body was UNK-46 his UNK-477 were UNK-178 . on 
 and on and on and on he UNK-536 far out over the UNK-346 singing UNK-659 
 to the sea UNK-273 to UNK-366 the UNK-534 of the life that had UNK-5 to him . 
 UNK-0 
 her image had passed into his soul for ever and no word had broken the 
 holy silence of his UNK-119 . her eyes had called him and his soul had 
 UNK-714 at the call . to live to UNK-788 to fall to triumph to UNK-492 
 life out of life ! a wild angel had appeared to him the angel of UNK-235 
 youth and beauty an UNK-432 from the fair courts of life to throw open 
 before him in an instant of UNK-119 the gates of all the ways of error 
 and glory . on and on and on and on ! 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-46 suddenly and heard his heart in the silence . how far had he 
 walked ? what hour was it ? 
 UNK-0 
 there was no human figure near him nor any sound UNK-618 to him over the 
 air . but the tide was near the turn and already the day was on the 
 UNK-437 . he turned UNK-929 and ran towards the shore and running up the 
 UNK-576 beach UNK-573 of the sharp UNK-623 found a sandy UNK-933 UNK-22 a 
 ring of UNK-511 UNK-407 and lay down there that the peace and silence 
 of the evening might still the UNK-306 of his blood . 
 UNK-0 
 he felt above him the vast UNK-942 dome and the calm processes of 
 the UNK-198 bodies and the earth beneath him the earth that had 
 UNK-618 him had taken him to her breast . 
 UNK-0 
 he closed his eyes in the UNK-389 of sleep . his UNK-863 UNK-515 as if 
 they felt the vast UNK-706 movement of the earth and her UNK-562 
 UNK-515 as if they felt the strange light of some new world . his soul 
 was UNK-158 into some new world fantastic dim UNK-481 as under 
 sea UNK-319 by cloudy shapes and beings . a world a UNK-133 or a 
 flower ? UNK-137 and UNK-178 trembling and UNK-549 a breaking 
 light an opening flower it spread in endless UNK-141 to itself 
 breaking in full UNK-962 and UNK-549 and UNK-546 to UNK-602 rose leaf 
 by leaf and wave of light by wave of light UNK-32 all the UNK-100 
 with its soft UNK-22 every flush deeper than the other . 
 UNK-0 
 evening had fallen when he UNK-911 and the sand and UNK-863 UNK-615 of his 
 bed UNK-78 no longer . he rose slowly and UNK-371 the UNK-809 of his 
 sleep UNK-279 at its joy . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-350 to the crest of the UNK-825 and UNK-84 about him . evening 
 had fallen . a rim of the young moon UNK-841 the pale waste of UNK-941 
 the rim of a silver UNK-983 embedded in grey sand and the tide was 
 UNK-441 in fast to the land with a low UNK-365 of her waves UNK-132 
 a few last figures in distant pools .

 UNK-0 
 he UNK-962 his third cup of UNK-138 tea to the UNK-559 and set to UNK-574 
 the UNK-483 of UNK-49 bread that were UNK-824 near him UNK-151 into 
 the dark pool of the jar . the yellow UNK-827 had been UNK-151 out like 
 a UNK-108 and the pool under it brought back to his memory the dark 
 UNK-451 water of the bath in UNK-202 . the box of UNK-858 tickets 
 at his UNK-213 had just been UNK-660 and he took up UNK-864 one after another 
 in his UNK-830 fingers the blue and white UNK-909 UNK-812 and UNK-411 
 and UNK-756 and bearing the name of the UNK-797 as UNK-954 or UNK-963 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-74 pair UNK-250 . 
 UNK-0  UNK-74 d . coat . 
 UNK-0  UNK-225 articles and white . 
 UNK-0  UNK-74 UNK-54 pants . 
 UNK-0 
 then he put them aside and UNK-84 UNK-711 at the lid of the box 
 UNK-346 with UNK-415 marks and asked UNK-489 
 UNK-0 
 how much is the clock fast now ? 
 UNK-0 
 his mother UNK-195 the UNK-36 alarm clock that was lying on its 
 side in the middle of the UNK-425 until its dial showed a quarter 
 to twelve and then laid it once more on its side . 
 UNK-0 
 an hour and UNK-48 minutes she said . the right time now is 
 twenty past ten . the dear knows you might try to be in time for your 
 lectures . 
 UNK-0 
 fill out the place for me to wash said stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-228 fill out the place for stephen to wash . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-792 fill out the place for stephen to wash . 
 UNK-0 
 i cant im going for blue . fill it out you UNK-10 . 
 UNK-0 
 when the UNK-719 basin had been fitted into the well of the sink and 
 the old washing UNK-516 UNK-168 on the side of it he allowed his mother to 
 UNK-889 his neck and root into the UNK-47 of his ears and into the 
 UNK-350 at the wings of his nose . 
 UNK-0 
 well its a poor case she said when a university student is so 
 dirty that his mother has to wash him . 
 UNK-0 
 but it gives you pleasure said stephen UNK-331 . 
 UNK-0 
 an UNK-388 UNK-266 was heard from UNK-316 and his mother UNK-243 
 a UNK-261 overall into his hands saying 
 UNK-0 
 dry yourself and UNK-282 out for the love of UNK-403 . 
 UNK-0 
 a second UNK-367 UNK-266 UNK-609 UNK-551 brought one of the girls to 
 the foot of the UNK-116 . 
 UNK-0 
 yes father ? 
 UNK-0 
 is your lazy bitch of a brother gone out yet ? 
 UNK-0 
 yes father . 
 UNK-0 
 sure ? 
 UNK-0 
 yes father . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-723 ! 
 UNK-0 
 the girl came back making signs to him to be quick and go out UNK-40 
 by the back . stephen UNK-20 and said 
 UNK-0 
 he has a curious idea of UNK-165 if he thinks a bitch is UNK-443 . 
 UNK-0 
 ah its a UNK-399 shame for you stephen said his mother and 
 UNK-85 live to UNK-10 the day you set your foot in that place . i know how 
 it has changed you . 
 UNK-0 
 good morning everybody said stephen UNK-21 and kissing the tips 
 of his fingers in UNK-845 . 
 UNK-0 
 the lane behind the terrace was UNK-218 and as he went down it 
 slowly choosing his steps UNK-22 UNK-436 of wet UNK-646 he heard a mad 
 UNK-642 UNK-561 in the UNK-71 UNK-431 beyond the wall . 
 UNK-0 
 jesus ! o jesus ! jesus ! 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-35 the sound out of his ears by an angry UNK-875 of his head and 
 UNK-569 on UNK-627 through the UNK-737 UNK-97 his heart already 
 UNK-696 by an UNK-223 of UNK-820 and UNK-321 . his fathers UNK-266 his 
 mothers UNK-543 the UNK-445 of an UNK-768 UNK-735 were to him now so 
 many voices UNK-518 and threatening to UNK-369 the pride of his youth . 
 he drove their UNK-691 even out of his heart with an UNK-817 but as 
 he walked down the avenue and felt the grey morning light falling about 
 him through the UNK-827 trees and UNK-616 the strange wild smell of the 
 wet leaves and UNK-19 his soul was UNK-229 of her UNK-712 . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-689 trees of the avenue UNK-685 in him as always memories 
 of the girls and women in the plays of UNK-35 UNK-863 and the 
 memory of their pale UNK-694 and the fragrance falling from the wet 
 branches UNK-907 in a mood of quiet joy . his morning walk across the 
 city had begun and he UNK-834 that as he passed the UNK-477 of 
 UNK-443 he would think of the UNK-478 UNK-75 UNK-312 of newman 
 that as he walked along the north strand road UNK-220 UNK-864 at the 
 windows of the provision shops he would recall the dark UNK-179 of 
 UNK-685 UNK-829 and smile that as he went by UNK-662 UNK-384 
 works in UNK-548 place the spirit of UNK-637 would blow through him like a 
 keen wind a spirit of UNK-752 UNK-848 beauty and that passing a UNK-578 
 marine dealers shop beyond the UNK-564 he would repeat the song by ben 
 UNK-589 which begins 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  i was not UNK-293 where i lay . 
 UNK-0 
 his mind when UNK-458 of its search for the essence of beauty UNK-22 the 
 UNK-642 words of UNK-613 or UNK-582 turned often for its pleasure to 
 the UNK-888 songs of the UNK-162 . his mind in the UNK-585 of a 
 UNK-874 UNK-235 stood often in shadow under the windows of that age to 
 hear the grave and UNK-55 music of the UNK-907 or the frank UNK-31 
 of UNK-649 until a laugh too low a phrase UNK-64 by time 
 of UNK-399 and false UNK-88 UNK-257 his UNK-883 pride and drove him on 
 from his UNK-692 . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-547 which he was believed to pass his days UNK-524 upon so that 
 it had UNK-827 him from the UNK-678 of youth was only a UNK-6 of 
 UNK-293 sentences from UNK-169 UNK-333 and psychology and a 
 synopsis UNK-167 UNK-361 ad UNK-491 UNK-329 UNK-643 . his thinking 
 was a UNK-322 of doubt and UNK-440 lit up at moments by the 
 UNK-764 of UNK-73 but UNK-764 of so clear a UNK-69 that in 
 those moments the world UNK-60 about his feet as if it had been 
 UNK-599 and thereafter his tongue grew heavy and he met the eyes 
 of others with UNK-424 eyes for he felt that the spirit of beauty 
 had UNK-177 him round like a UNK-939 and that in UNK-562 at least he had 
 been UNK-265 with UNK-21 . but when this brief pride of 
 silence UNK-165 him no longer he was glad to find himself 
 still in the UNK-619 of common lives passing on his way UNK-22 the UNK-499 
 and noise and UNK-830 of the city UNK-359 and with a light heart . 
 UNK-0 
 near the UNK-235 on the canal he met the UNK-904 man with the 
 dolls face and the UNK-449 hat coming towards him down the slope of 
 the bridge with little steps UNK-651 UNK-872 into his chocolate 
 UNK-319 and holding his UNK-843 UNK-148 a span or two from him like a 
 UNK-555 rod . it must be eleven he thought and UNK-427 into a dairy to 
 see the time . the clock in the dairy told him that it was five minutes 
 to five but as he turned away he heard a clock somewhere near him 
 but UNK-768 UNK-570 eleven UNK-684 in swift precision . he UNK-20 as he 
 heard it for it made him think of UNK-324 and he saw him a UNK-737 figure 
 in a shooting jacket and UNK-468 and with a fair UNK-297 standing in 
 the wind at hopkins corner and heard him say 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-1 UNK-14 an UNK-844 being wrapped up in yourself . im 
 not . im a democrat and ill work and act for social liberty and 
 equality among all classes and UNK-250 in the united states of the europe 
 of the future . 
 UNK-0 
 eleven ! then he was late for that lecture too . what day of the week was 
 it ? he stopped at a UNK-80 to read the headline of a UNK-547 . 
 thursday . ten to eleven english eleven to twelve french twelve to 
 one physics . he UNK-87 to himself the english lecture and felt even 
 at that distance UNK-741 and UNK-41 . he saw the heads of his 
 UNK-192 UNK-428 bent as they wrote in their notebooks the points they 
 were UNK-334 to note UNK-971 definitions essential definitions and 
 examples or dates of birth or death chief works a UNK-638 and an 
 UNK-328 criticism side by side . his own head was UNK-304 for his 
 thoughts UNK-326 abroad and whether he looked around the little class 
 of students or out of the window across the UNK-722 gardens of the 
 green an UNK-143 UNK-711 him of UNK-664 UNK-210 and UNK-857 . another 
 head than his right before him in the first UNK-674 was UNK-834 
 UNK-258 above its UNK-277 UNK-13 like the head of a priest UNK-662 
 without UNK-551 to the UNK-601 for the UNK-369 UNK-903 about 
 him . why was it that when he thought of UNK-12 he could never raise 
 before his mind the entire image of his body but only the image of the 
 head and face ? even now against the grey UNK-622 of the morning he saw 
 it before him like the phantom of a dream the face of a UNK-509 head 
 or UNK-182 UNK-818 on the UNK-490 by its UNK-257 black UNK-539 hair as 
 by an iron crown . it was a UNK-357 face UNK-357 in its UNK-888 
 in the wide UNK-663 nose in the UNK-414 below the eyes and along the 
 UNK-968 UNK-357 in the lips that were long and UNK-934 and UNK-284 
 UNK-21 and stephen UNK-617 UNK-171 how he had told UNK-12 of all 
 the UNK-298 and UNK-927 and UNK-102 in his soul day after day and 
 night by night only to be answered by his friends listening silence 
 would have told himself that it was the face of a guilty priest who 
 heard UNK-67 of those whom he had not power to UNK-422 but that he 
 felt again in memory the UNK-49 of its dark UNK-298 eyes . 
 UNK-0 
 through this image he had a UNK-332 of a strange dark UNK-340 of 
 UNK-886 but at once turned away from it feeling that it was not 
 yet the hour to enter it . but the UNK-424 of his friends 
 UNK-207 seemed to be UNK-203 in the air around him a UNK-347 and 
 deadly UNK-925 and he found himself UNK-220 from one casual word to 
 another on his right or left in UNK-30 wonder that they had been so 
 UNK-173 UNK-198 of UNK-288 sense until every mean shop legend 
 bound his mind like the words of a spell and his soul UNK-421 up 
 UNK-475 with age as he walked on in a lane among UNK-436 of dead 
 language . his own consciousness of language was UNK-245 from his brain 
 and UNK-169 into the very words themselves which set to band and 
 UNK-343 themselves in UNK-752 UNK-998 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  the UNK-390 UNK-140 upon the wall 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  and UNK-140 and UNK-220 upon the wall 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  the yellow UNK-390 upon the wall 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-390 ivy up the wall . 
 UNK-0 
 did anyone ever hear such UNK-512 ? lord UNK-783 ! who ever heard of UNK-390 
 UNK-846 on a wall ? yellow UNK-390 that was all right . yellow ivory also . 
 and what about ivory UNK-390 ? 
 UNK-0 
 the word now UNK-493 in his brain UNK-598 and UNK-367 than any ivory 
 UNK-920 from the UNK-201 UNK-800 of UNK-299 . ivory UNK-294 UNK-879 UNK-385 . 
 one of the first examples that he had UNK-294 in latin had run 
 india UNK-979 UNK-385 and he UNK-225 the UNK-295 northern face of the 
 UNK-96 who had taught him to UNK-867 the UNK-646 of UNK-976 in a 
 UNK-997 english made UNK-688 by the mention of UNK-377 and UNK-992 
 and UNK-953 of bacon . he had UNK-294 what little he knew of the laws of 
 latin verse from a UNK-884 book written by a portuguese priest . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-694 UNK-241 UNK-735 in UNK-586 UNK-408 . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-175 and UNK-840 and UNK-339 in roman history were handed on 
 to him in the UNK-484 words in UNK-742 UNK-570 and he had tried to peer 
 into the social life of the city of cities through the words UNK-724 
 UNK-462 UNK-163 which the UNK-96 had rendered UNK-84 as the 
 filling of a pot with UNK-264 . the pages of his UNK-577 UNK-630 never 
 felt cold to the touch even when his own fingers were cold they were 
 human pages and fifty years before they had been turned by the human 
 fingers of john duncan UNK-915 and by his brother william UNK-381 
 UNK-915 . yes those were noble names on the UNK-68 UNK-155 and even 
 for so poor a UNK-867 as he the UNK-68 UNK-351 were as UNK-23 as 
 though they had UNK-89 all those years in myrtle and UNK-534 and 
 UNK-422 but yet it UNK-110 him to think that he would never be but a 
 UNK-523 guest at the UNK-555 of the worlds culture and that the UNK-883 
 learning in terms of which he was UNK-103 to forge out an UNK-175 
 philosophy was held no higher by the age he lived in than the subtle 
 and curious UNK-668 of UNK-481 and UNK-542 . 
 UNK-0 
 the grey block of trinity on his left set heavily in the UNK-89 
 UNK-678 like a UNK-66 stone set in a UNK-581 ring pulled his mind 
 UNK-874 and while he was UNK-103 this way and that to free his feet 
 from the UNK-579 of the UNK-439 UNK-212 he came upon the UNK-607 
 UNK-287 of the national poet of ireland . 
 UNK-0 
 he looked at it without anger for though UNK-830 of the body and of the 
 soul UNK-270 over it like UNK-768 UNK-579 over the UNK-910 feet and up 
 the UNK-47 of the UNK-382 and around the UNK-40 head it seemed UNK-970 
 conscious of its UNK-267 . it was a UNK-610 in the UNK-935 UNK-382 of a 
 UNK-477 and he thought of his friend UNK-232 the UNK-720 student . it 
 was a UNK-730 name between them but the young UNK-720 UNK-135 with it 
 UNK-79 
 UNK-0 
 go on UNK-660 i have a hard head you tell me . call me what you 
 will . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-393 version of his christian name on the lips of his friend had 
 touched stephen UNK-477 when first heard for he was as formal in 
 speech with others as they were with him . often as he sat in UNK-962 
 rooms in UNK-924 street wondering at his friends UNK-466 boots 
 that UNK-69 the wall pair by pair and UNK-598 for his friends 
 simple ear the UNK-351 and UNK-77 of others which were the UNK-523 of 
 his own UNK-868 and UNK-904 the UNK-292 UNK-610 mind of his UNK-584 
 had drawn his mind towards it and UNK-168 it back again drawing it by a 
 quiet UNK-94 courtesy of attention or by a UNK-495 turn of old english 
 speech or by the force of its delight in UNK-292 UNK-919 UNK-560 UNK-232 
 had sat at the feet of michael UNK-988 the UNK-590 UNK-171 and 
 suddenly by a UNK-676 of intelligence or by a UNK-762 of feeling or 
 by a UNK-66 UNK-855 of terror in the eyes the terror of soul of a UNK-266 
 irish village in which the UNK-538 was still a UNK-803 fear . 
 UNK-0 
 side by side with his memory of the UNK-898 of UNK-224 of his uncle mat 
 UNK-232 the UNK-495 the young UNK-720 UNK-516 the UNK-564 legend 
 of ireland . the gossip of his UNK-727 which UNK-952 to render 
 the flat life of the college significant at any cost loved to think of 
 him as a young UNK-514 . his nurse had taught him irish and shaped his 
 UNK-292 imagination by the broken lights of irish myth . he stood towards 
 the myth upon which no individual mind had ever drawn out a line of 
 beauty and to its UNK-456 tales that divided against themselves as 
 they moved down the cycles in the same attitude as towards the roman 
 catholic religion the attitude of a UNK-243 UNK-188 UNK-839 . UNK-303 
 of thought or of feeling came to him from england or by way of english 
 culture his mind stood armed against in UNK-268 to a password and of 
 the world that lay beyond england he knew only the foreign UNK-251 of 
 france in which he spoke of serving . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-284 this UNK-570 with the young UNK-54 UNK-179 stephen had often 
 called him one of the UNK-560 UNK-793 and there was even a point of 
 UNK-747 in the name pointed against that very UNK-767 of speech 
 and UNK-448 in his friend which seemed so often to stand between UNK-8 
 mind UNK-44 of UNK-886 and the hidden ways of irish life . 
 UNK-0 
 one night the young UNK-720 his spirit UNK-257 by the violent or 
 UNK-66 language in which stephen UNK-525 from the cold silence of 
 intellectual UNK-978 had called up before UNK-8 mind a strange 
 vision . the two were walking slowly towards UNK-962 rooms through the 
 dark narrow streets of the UNK-615 jews . 
 UNK-0 
 a thing happened to myself UNK-660 last autumn coming on winter 
 and i never told it to a living soul and you are the first person now i 
 ever told it to . i UNK-543 if it was october or november . it was 
 october because it was before i came up here to join the UNK-851 
 class . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen had turned his UNK-21 eyes towards his friends face 
 UNK-160 by his confidence and won over to sympathy by the speakers 
 simple accent . 
 UNK-0 
 i was away all that day from my own place over in UNK-669 . 
 UNK-0 
 i dont know if you know where that UNK-445 a UNK-693 match between 
 the UNK-959 own boys and the UNK-520 UNK-368 and by god UNK-660 that 
 was the hard fight . my first UNK-664 UNK-854 UNK-232 was UNK-627 to his 
 UNK-527 that day UNK-641 cool for the UNK-602 but he was up with the 
 UNK-914 half the time and UNK-929 like mad . i never will forget that 
 day . one of the UNK-959 made a UNK-749 UNK-801 at him one time with his 
 UNK-988 and i declare to god he was within an aims ace of getting it at 
 the side of his temple . oh honest to god if the UNK-913 of it caught 
 him that time he was done for . 
 UNK-0 
 i am glad he UNK-525 stephen had said with a laugh but surely 
 thats not the strange thing that happened you ? 
 UNK-0 
 well i suppose that UNK-55 interest you but UNK-92 there was 
 such noise after the match that i missed the train home and i UNK-18 
 get any kind of a UNK-817 to give me a lift for as luck would have it 
 there was a mass meeting that same day over in UNK-118 and 
 all the cars in the country were there . so there was nothing for it 
 only to stay the night or to foot it out . well i started to walk 
 and on i went and it was coming on night when i got into the UNK-964 
 hills thats better than ten miles from UNK-187 and UNK-6 a 
 long lonely road after that . you UNK-9 see the sign of a christian 
 house along the road or hear a sound . it was pitch dark almost . once 
 or twice i stopped by the way under a bush to UNK-289 my pipe and only 
 for the UNK-826 was thick id have UNK-269 out there and UNK-613 . at last 
 after a bend of the road i UNK-848 a little cottage with a light in the 
 window . i went up and UNK-442 at the door . a voice asked who was 
 there and i answered i was over at the match in UNK-669 and was 
 walking back and that id be UNK-277 for a glass of water . after 
 a while a young woman opened the door and brought me out a big mug 
 of milk . she was half UNK-753 as if she was going to bed when i 
 UNK-442 and she had her hair hanging and i thought by her figure and 
 by something in the look of her eyes that she must be carrying a 
 child . she kept me in talk a long while at the door and i thought 
 it strange because her breast and her UNK-61 were bare . she 
 asked me was i tired and would i like to stop the night there . 
 she said she was all alone in the house and that her husband had 
 gone that morning to UNK-74 with his sister to see her off . and all 
 the time she was talking UNK-660 she had her eyes fixed on my face and 
 she stood so close to me i could hear her breathing . when i handed her 
 back the mug at last she took my hand to draw me in over the threshold 
 and said come in and stay the night here . UNK-628 no call to be 
 UNK-979 . UNK-6 no one in it but ourselves . . . i UNK-3 go in 
 UNK-660 . i UNK-433 her and went on my way again all in a fever . at the 
 first bend of the road i looked back and she was standing at the door . 
 UNK-0 
 the last words of UNK-962 story UNK-57 in his memory and the figure of 
 the woman in the story stood forth reflected in other figures of the 
 UNK-720 women whom he had seen standing in the UNK-400 at UNK-166 as the 
 college cars drove by as a type of her race and of his own a UNK-149 
 soul UNK-632 to the consciousness of itself in darkness and UNK-957 and 
 UNK-964 and through the eyes and voice and UNK-359 of a woman 
 without UNK-200 calling the stranger to her bed . 
 UNK-0 
 a hand was laid on his arm and a young voice UNK-5 
 UNK-0 
 ah gentleman your own girl sir ! the first UNK-307 today gentleman . 
 buy that lovely bunch . will you gentleman ? 
 UNK-0 
 the blue flowers which she UNK-64 towards him and her young blue eyes 
 seemed to him at that instant images of UNK-665 and he UNK-46 
 till the image had UNK-134 and he saw only her UNK-884 dress and UNK-261 
 UNK-997 hair and UNK-169 face . 
 UNK-0 
 do gentleman ! dont forget your own girl sir ! 
 UNK-0 
 i have no money said stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 buy them lovely ones will you sir ? only a penny . 
 UNK-0 
 did you hear what i said ? asked stephen UNK-277 towards her . i told you 
 i had no money . i tell you again now . 
 UNK-0 
 well sure you will some day sir please god the girl answered 
 after an instant . 
 UNK-0 
 possibly said stephen but i dont think it likely . 
 UNK-0 
 he left her quickly UNK-143 that her UNK-609 might turn to UNK-883 
 and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to 
 another a tourist from england or a student of trinity . UNK-804 
 street along which he walked UNK-609 that moment of UNK-771 
 poverty . in the UNK-992 at the head of the street a UNK-758 was set to the 
 memory of UNK-239 tone and he remembered having been present with his 
 father at its UNK-889 . he remembered with UNK-321 that scene of 
 UNK-627 tribute . there were four french UNK-305 in a brake and one a 
 UNK-191 UNK-21 young man held UNK-876 on a stick a card on which were 
 printed the words UNK-324 UNK-464 ! 
 UNK-0 
 but the trees in UNK-8 green were UNK-23 of rain and the 
 UNK-775 earth gave forth its UNK-235 UNK-143 a UNK-90 UNK-402 rising 
 UNK-266 through the UNK-596 from many hearts . the soul of the UNK-995 
 UNK-625 city which his UNK-505 had told him of had UNK-381 with time to a 
 UNK-90 UNK-235 UNK-143 rising from the earth and he knew that in a moment 
 when he entered the UNK-967 college he would be conscious of a 
 corruption other than that of buck UNK-67 and UNK-33 UNK-915 . 
 UNK-0 
 it was too late to go UNK-316 to the french class . he UNK-112 the hall 
 and took the UNK-366 to the left which led to the physics theatre . the 
 UNK-366 was dark and silent but not UNK-984 . why did he feel that 
 it was not UNK-984 ? was it because he had heard that in buck 
 UNK-354 time there was a secret UNK-116 there ? or was the UNK-249 
 house UNK-161 and was he walking among UNK-436 ? the ireland of 
 tone and of UNK-121 seemed to have UNK-437 in space . 
 UNK-0 
 he opened the door of the theatre and UNK-46 in the UNK-618 grey light 
 that UNK-250 through the UNK-673 windows . a figure was UNK-625 before 
 the large UNK-886 and by its UNK-71 and UNK-794 he knew that it was 
 the dean of studies lighting the fire . stephen closed the door UNK-40 
 and UNK-596 the fireplace . 
 UNK-0 
 good morning sir ! can i help you ? 
 UNK-0 
 the priest looked up quickly and said 
 UNK-0 
 one moment now mr UNK-1 and you will see . there is an art in 
 lighting a fire . we have the liberal arts and we have the useful arts . 
 this is one of the useful arts . 
 UNK-0 
 i will try to learn it said stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 not too much coal said the dean working UNK-587 at his task that 
 is one of the secrets . 
 UNK-0 
 he produced four UNK-244 from the UNK-781 of his UNK-825 and 
 placed them UNK-765 among the UNK-918 and twisted papers . stephen watched 
 him in silence . UNK-755 thus on the UNK-108 to UNK-650 the fire and 
 UNK-536 with the disposition of his UNK-454 of paper and UNK-244 he 
 seemed more than ever a UNK-369 server making ready the place of 
 sacrifice in an empty temple a UNK-523 of the lord . like a UNK-78 
 UNK-905 of plain UNK-683 the UNK-238 worn UNK-825 UNK-658 the UNK-755 figure 
 of one whom the UNK-174 or the UNK-835 UNK-66 would UNK-654 and 
 trouble . his very body had UNK-22 old in UNK-388 service of the UNK-256 
 UNK-938 the fire upon the UNK-92 in bearing UNK-500 UNK-935 in 
 waiting upon UNK-224 in striking UNK-171 when UNK-192 yet had 
 remained UNK-592 by UNK-461 of UNK-385 or of UNK-502 beauty . UNK-376 his 
 very soul had UNK-22 old in that service without growing towards light 
 and beauty or spreading abroad a sweet UNK-143 of her UNK-613 
 UNK-98 will no more UNK-123 to the UNK-447 of its UNK-268 than 
 was to the UNK-447 of love or combat his UNK-969 body spare and UNK-449 
 UNK-482 with a UNK-217 down . 
 UNK-0 
 the dean UNK-346 back on his UNK-204 and watched the sticks catch . 
 stephen to fill the silence said 
 UNK-0 
 i am sure i could not light a fire . 
 UNK-0 
 you are an artist are you not mr UNK-1 ? said the dean UNK-220 
 up and UNK-717 his pale eyes . the object of the artist is the creation 
 of the beautiful . what the beautiful is is another question . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-866 his hands slowly and UNK-54 over the difficulty . 
 UNK-0 
 can you solve that question now ? he asked . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-582 answered stephen says UNK-886 UNK-767 UNK-760 visa UNK-777 . 
 UNK-0 
 this fire before us said the dean will be UNK-238 to the eye . 
 will it therefore be beautiful ? 
 UNK-0 
 in so far as it is UNK-943 by the sight which i suppose means 
 here UNK-175 UNK-464 it will be beautiful . but UNK-582 also says 
 UNK-275 est in UNK-711 UNK-705 UNK-678 . in so far as it UNK-163 the 
 animal UNK-481 for UNK-635 fire is a good . in hell however it is an 
 evil . 
 UNK-0 
 quite so said the dean you have certainly hit the nail on the head . 
 UNK-0 
 he rose UNK-901 and went towards the door set it UNK-961 and said 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-643 is said to be a help in these matters . 
 UNK-0 
 as he came back to the UNK-679 UNK-403 slightly but with a UNK-517 step 
 stephen saw the silent soul of a UNK-249 look out at him from the pale 
 UNK-941 eyes . like UNK-77 he was UNK-201 but in his eyes UNK-416 no 
 UNK-125 of UNK-744 UNK-311 . even the legendary craft of the 
 company a craft UNK-579 and more secret than its UNK-536 books of 
 secret subtle wisdom had not fired his soul with the energy of 
 UNK-428 . it seemed as if he used the UNK-611 and UNK-547 and UNK-650 of 
 the world as UNK-334 to do for the greater glory of god without joy 
 in their handling or UNK-985 of that in them which was evil but turning 
 them with a firm UNK-359 of UNK-268 back upon themselves and for all 
 this silent service it seemed as if he loved not at all the master and 
 little if at all the ends he served . UNK-883 UNK-918 UNK-189 UNK-347 
 he was as the founder would have had him like a staff in an old UNK-54 
 hand to be UNK-122 on in the road at UNK-351 or in stress of weather 
 to lie with a UNK-532 UNK-766 on a garden seat to be raised in UNK-254 . 
 UNK-0 
 the dean returned to the UNK-679 and began to stroke his UNK-333 . 
 UNK-0 
 when may we expect to have something from you on the UNK-175 
 question ? he asked . 
 UNK-0 
 from me ! said stephen in UNK-944 . i UNK-40 on an idea once a 
 UNK-568 if i am lucky . 
 UNK-0 
 these questions are very UNK-240 mr UNK-1 said the dean . it is 
 like looking down from the UNK-265 of UNK-794 into the UNK-855 . many go 
 down into the UNK-855 and never come up . only the trained UNK-878 can go 
 down into those UNK-855 and explore them and come to the surface again . 
 UNK-0 
 if you mean UNK-886 sir said stephen i also am sure that 
 there is no such thing as free thinking UNK-581 as all thinking must 
 be bound by its own laws . 
 UNK-0 
 ha ! 
 UNK-0 
 for my purpose i can work on at present by the light of one or two 
 ideas of UNK-613 and UNK-582 . 
 UNK-0 
 i see . i quite see your point . 
 UNK-0 
 i need them only for my own use and guidance until i have done 
 something for myself by their light . if the lamp UNK-68 or UNK-908 i 
 shall try to trim it . if it does not give light enough i shall sell it 
 and buy another . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-678 also had a lamp said the dean which was sold for a fancy 
 price after his death . it was the lamp he wrote his UNK-62 
 UNK-585 by . you know UNK-678 ? 
 UNK-0 
 an old gentleman said stephen UNK-612 who said that the soul is 
 very like a UNK-709 of water . 
 UNK-0 
 he tells us in his UNK-393 way the dean went on that he put an iron 
 lamp before a UNK-287 of one of the gods and that a UNK-547 UNK-273 the 
 lamp . what did the UNK-499 do ? he reflected that it was in the 
 character of a UNK-547 to steal and determined to buy an UNK-282 lamp 
 next day instead of the iron lamp . 
 UNK-0 
 a smell of UNK-820 UNK-284 came up from the UNK-46 candle butts and UNK-174 
 itself in UNK-8 consciousness with the UNK-298 of the words UNK-283 
 and lamp and lamp and UNK-283 . the UNK-73 voice too had a hard 
 UNK-828 tone . UNK-8 mind UNK-46 by UNK-375 checked by the 
 strange tone and the UNK-439 and by the UNK-73 face which seemed like 
 an UNK-698 lamp or a UNK-792 hung in a false focus . what lay behind it 
 or within it ? a UNK-66 UNK-577 of the soul or the UNK-500 of the 
 UNK-728 charged with UNK-464 and capable of the UNK-286 of 
 god ? 
 UNK-0 
 i meant a different kind of lamp sir said stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-590 said the dean . 
 UNK-0 
 one difficulty said stephen in UNK-175 discussion is to know 
 whether words are being used according to the literary tradition or 
 according to the tradition of the marketplace . i remember a sentence of 
 UNK-769 in which he says of the blessed virgin that she was UNK-839 
 in the full company of the saints . the use of the word in the 
 marketplace is quite different . i hope i am not UNK-626 you . 
 UNK-0 
 not in the least said the dean UNK-269 . 
 UNK-0 
 no no said stephen UNK-21 i mean 
 UNK-0 
 yes yes i see said the dean quickly i quite catch the point 
 UNK-296 . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-243 forward his under UNK-110 and UNK-420 a dry short UNK-766 . 
 UNK-0 
 to return to the lamp he said the feeding of it is also a nice 
 problem . you must choose the pure oil and you must be careful when you 
 pour it in not to UNK-385 it not to pour in more than the UNK-546 can 
 hold . 
 UNK-0 
 what UNK-546 ? asked stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-546 through which you pour the oil into your lamp . 
 UNK-0 
 that ? said stephen . is that called a UNK-546 ? is it not a UNK-802 ? 
 UNK-0 
 what is a UNK-802 ? 
 UNK-0 
 that . the . . . UNK-546 . 
 UNK-0 
 is that called a UNK-802 in ireland ? asked the dean . i never heard 
 the word in my life . 
 UNK-0 
 it is called a UNK-802 in lower UNK-146 said stephen laughing 
 where they speak the best english . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-802 said the dean UNK-27 . that is a most interesting 
 word . i must look that word up . upon my word i must . 
 UNK-0 
 his courtesy of manner UNK-459 a little false and stephen looked at the 
 english convert with the same eyes as the elder brother in the UNK-582 
 may have turned on the UNK-186 . a UNK-369 UNK-765 in the wake of 
 UNK-170 UNK-253 a poor UNK-999 in ireland he seemed to have 
 entered on the stage of UNK-249 history when that strange play of 
 UNK-585 and suffering and UNK-934 and struggle and UNK-267 had been all 
 but given UNK-202 UNK-53 a UNK-128 spirit . from what had he set 
 out ? perhaps he had been born and UNK-338 among serious UNK-73 seeing 
 salvation in jesus only and UNK-629 the UNK-398 UNK-536 of the 
 establishment . had he felt the need of an UNK-58 faith UNK-22 the 
 UNK-768 of UNK-539 and the UNK-994 of its UNK-617 UNK-675 six 
 principle men UNK-702 people seed and snake UNK-4 UNK-969 
 UNK-576 ? had he found the true church all of a sudden in UNK-407 up 
 to the end like a reel of cotton some UNK-103 line of reasoning upon 
 UNK-313 on the UNK-325 of hands or the UNK-643 of the holy 
 ghost ? or had lord christ touched him and UNK-334 him follow like that 
 UNK-97 who had sat at the receipt of custom as he sat by the door of 
 some UNK-711 chapel UNK-687 and telling over his church UNK-443 ? 
 UNK-0 
 the dean repeated the word yet again . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-802 ! well now that is interesting ! 
 UNK-0 
 the question you asked me a moment ago seems to me more interesting . 
 what is that beauty which the artist UNK-46 to express from UNK-882 of 
 earth said stephen UNK-482 . 
 UNK-0 
 the little word seemed to have turned a UNK-917 point of his 
 UNK-623 against this UNK-819 and UNK-521 UNK-54 . he felt with a 
 smart of UNK-904 that the man to whom he was speaking was a 
 UNK-699 of ben UNK-589 . he thought 
 UNK-0 
 the language in which we are speaking is his before it is mine . how 
 different are the words home christ UNK-556 master on his lips and on 
 mine ! i UNK-216 speak or write these words without UNK-927 of spirit . his 
 language so familiar and so foreign will always be for me an acquired 
 speech . i have not made or accepted its words . my voice holds them at 
 bay . my soul UNK-501 in the shadow of his language . 
 UNK-0 
 and to UNK-733 between the beautiful and the sublime the dean 
 added to UNK-733 between moral beauty and material beauty . and to 
 inquire what kind of beauty is proper to each of the various arts . 
 these are some interesting points we might take up . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-843 suddenly by the UNK-46 firm dry tone was 
 silent and through the silence a distant noise of many boots and 
 confused voices came up the UNK-116 . 
 UNK-0 
 in UNK-360 these UNK-454 said the dean UNK-52 there 
 is however the danger of UNK-161 of UNK-287 . first you must take 
 your degree . set that before you as your first aim . then little by 
 little you will see your way . i mean in every sense your way in life 
 and in thinking . it may be UNK-559 UNK-652 at first . take mr UNK-729 . 
 he was a long time before he got to the top . but he got there . 
 UNK-0 
 i may not have his talent said stephen UNK-40 . 
 UNK-0 
 you never know said the dean UNK-307 . we never can say what is in 
 us . i most certainly should not be UNK-215 . per UNK-590 ad UNK-353 . 
 UNK-0 
 he left the UNK-679 quickly and went towards the landing to UNK-612 the 
 arrival of the first arts class . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-200 against the fireplace stephen heard him UNK-366 UNK-587 and 
 UNK-967 every student of the class and could almost see the frank 
 UNK-479 of the UNK-580 students . a UNK-600 UNK-47 began to fall like 
 UNK-826 upon his easily UNK-321 heart for this UNK-620 UNK-225 of 
 the UNK-104 UNK-337 for this UNK-513 of the UNK-906 more UNK-625 
 than they in speech more UNK-968 of soul than they one whom he 
 would never call his UNK-675 father and he thought how this man and 
 his UNK-193 had earned the name of UNK-224 at the hands not of 
 the UNK-973 only but of the UNK-6 also for having UNK-162 during 
 all their history at the bar of gods justice for the souls of the UNK-169 
 and the UNK-2 and the UNK-381 . 
 UNK-0 
 the entry of the professor was UNK-179 by a few rounds of UNK-180 
 fire from the heavy boots of those students who sat on the highest tier 
 of the UNK-484 theatre under the grey UNK-973 windows . the calling of 
 the roll began and the responses to the names were given out in all 
 tones until the name of peter UNK-263 was reached . 
 UNK-0 
 here ! 
 UNK-0 
 a deep bass note in response came from the upper tier followed by 
 UNK-139 of protest along the other UNK-674 . 
 UNK-0 
 the professor UNK-214 in his reading and called the next name 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 ! 
 UNK-0 
 no answer . 
 UNK-0 
 mr UNK-12 ! 
 UNK-0 
 a smile UNK-230 across UNK-8 face as he thought of his friends 
 studies . 
 UNK-0 
 try UNK-25 ! said a voice from the bench behind . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-75 up quickly but UNK-594 UNK-739 face outlined on the 
 grey light was UNK-342 . a formula was given out . UNK-22 the UNK-245 of 
 the notebooks stephen turned back again and said 
 UNK-0 
 give me some paper for gods sake . 
 UNK-0 
 are you as bad as that ? asked UNK-916 with a broad UNK-205 . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-814 a sheet from his UNK-675 and passed it down UNK-387 
 UNK-0 
 in case of necessity any UNK-776 or woman can do it . 
 UNK-0 
 the formula which he wrote UNK-95 on the sheet of paper the 
 UNK-837 and UNK-171 calculations of the professor the UNK-610 
 symbols of force and velocity UNK-160 and UNK-901 UNK-8 mind . he 
 had heard some say that the old professor was an UNK-327 UNK-220 . o 
 the grey UNK-66 day ! it seemed a UNK-487 of UNK-571 patient consciousness 
 through which souls of UNK-453 might UNK-588 UNK-994 long 
 UNK-293 fabrics from plane to plane of ever UNK-953 and UNK-230 UNK-391 
 UNK-339 swift UNK-860 to the last UNK-94 of a universe ever UNK-279 
 UNK-199 and more UNK-378 . 
 UNK-0 
 so we must UNK-733 between UNK-856 and UNK-570 . perhaps some 
 of you UNK-32 may be familiar with the works of mr w . s . gilbert . in 
 one of his songs he speaks of the UNK-982 sharp who is UNK-475 to 
 play 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  on a cloth UNK-392 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  with a twisted UNK-106 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  and UNK-856 UNK-982 balls . 
 UNK-0 
 he means a ball having the form of the UNK-179 of the principal 
 UNK-384 of which i spoke a moment ago . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-916 UNK-122 down towards UNK-8 ear and UNK-203 
 UNK-0 
 what price UNK-570 balls ! chase me ladies im in the UNK-76 ! 
 UNK-0 
 his fellow students UNK-292 UNK-179 ran like a UNK-306 through the UNK-308 
 of UNK-8 mind UNK-144 into gay life UNK-544 UNK-766 UNK-272 that 
 hung upon the walls setting them to UNK-178 and UNK-72 in a UNK-345 of 
 UNK-148 . the forms of the community UNK-209 from the UNK-420 
 UNK-272 the dean of studies the UNK-658 UNK-451 UNK-397 with his cap 
 of grey hair the president the little priest with UNK-289 hair who 
 wrote UNK-636 UNK-351 the UNK-737 UNK-720 form of the professor of 
 economics the tall form of the young professor of mental science 
 discussing on the landing a case of UNK-212 with his class like a 
 UNK-744 UNK-295 high UNK-228 among a UNK-985 of UNK-318 the grave 
 UNK-371 UNK-89 of the UNK-173 the UNK-191 UNK-357 professor of 
 italian with his UNK-757 eyes . they came UNK-928 and UNK-627 
 UNK-311 and UNK-835 UNK-577 their UNK-208 for UNK-981 frog holding one 
 another back UNK-491 with deep false UNK-31 UNK-463 one another 
 behind and laughing at their UNK-292 UNK-953 calling to one another by 
 familiar UNK-357 UNK-975 with sudden UNK-491 at some rough usage 
 UNK-387 two and two behind their hands . 
 UNK-0 
 the professor had gone to the glass cases on the side wall from a 
 shelf of which he took down a set of UNK-887 UNK-299 away the dust from 
 many points and bearing it carefully to the table held a finger on it 
 while he UNK-360 with his lecture . he explained that the wires in 
 modern UNK-887 were of a compound called UNK-944 lately discovered by 
 f . w . UNK-458 . 
 UNK-0 
 he spoke clearly the UNK-642 and surname of the UNK-354 . UNK-916 
 UNK-222 from behind 
 UNK-0 
 good old fresh water martin ! 
 UNK-0 
 ask him stephen UNK-222 back with UNK-129 UNK-179 if he wants a 
 subject for UNK-112 . he can have me . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-916 seeing the professor bend over the UNK-887 rose in his bench 
 and UNK-106 UNK-963 the fingers of his right hand began to call 
 with the voice of a UNK-139 UNK-501 
 UNK-0 
 please teacher ! this boy is after saying a bad word teacher . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-944 the professor said UNK-505 is preferred to german 
 silver because it has a lower UNK-210 of resistance by changes of 
 temperature . the UNK-944 wire is UNK-121 and the covering of silk 
 that UNK-119 it is wound on the UNK-138 UNK-645 just where my finger 
 is . if it were wound single an extra current would be induced in the 
 UNK-887 . the UNK-645 are UNK-897 in hot UNK-678 wax . . . 
 UNK-0 
 a sharp UNK-174 voice said from the bench below stephen 
 UNK-0 
 are we likely to be asked questions on applied science ? 
 UNK-0 
 the professor began to UNK-214 UNK-141 with the terms pure science and 
 applied science . a UNK-969 student wearing gold UNK-815 UNK-156 
 with some wonder at the UNK-10 . UNK-916 UNK-203 from behind in 
 his natural voice 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-50 UNK-899 a devil for his pound of flesh ? 
 UNK-0 
 stephen looked UNK-482 on the UNK-51 UNK-241 beneath him UNK-938 with 
 UNK-480 UNK-65 hair . the voice the accent the mind of the 
 UNK-10 UNK-563 him and he allowed the UNK-0 to carry him towards 
 UNK-20 UNK-905 bidding his mind think that the students father 
 would have done better had he sent his son to belfast to study and have 
 saved something on the train fare by so doing . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-51 UNK-241 beneath did not turn to meet this shaft of thought and 
 yet the shaft came back to its UNK-306 for he saw in a moment the 
 students UNK-68 face . 
 UNK-0 
 that thought is not mine he said to himself quickly . it came from 
 the comic UNK-843 in the bench behind . UNK-435 . can you say with 
 UNK-50 by whom the soul of your race was UNK-490 and its elect 
 UNK-242 the UNK-10 or by the UNK-940 ? UNK-435 . remember 
 UNK-678 . it is probably in his character to ask such a question at 
 such a moment in such a tone and to UNK-272 the word science as a 
 UNK-915 . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-136 voice of the professor continued to wind itself slowly 
 round and round the UNK-887 it spoke of UNK-497 UNK-319 UNK-884 
 its UNK-986 energy as the UNK-659 UNK-133 its UNK-649 of resistance . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-594 voice called from behind in echo to a distant bell 
 UNK-0 
 closing time UNK-464 ! 
 UNK-0 
 the entrance hall was UNK-196 and loud with talk . on a table near the 
 door were two photographs in frames and between them a long roll of 
 paper bearing an UNK-167 tail of signatures . UNK-595 went UNK-587 to 
 and UNK-161 among the students talking rapidly answering UNK-744 and 
 leading one after another to the table . in the inner hall the dean of 
 studies stood talking to a young professor UNK-188 his UNK-333 UNK-141 
 and UNK-278 his head . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen checked by the crowd at the door UNK-46 UNK-997 . from 
 under the wide falling leaf of a soft hat UNK-368 dark eyes were 
 watching him . 
 UNK-0 
 have you signed ? stephen asked . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 closed his long UNK-43 mouth UNK-296 with himself an 
 instant and answered 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-414 UNK-258 . 
 UNK-0 
 what is it for ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-711 ? 
 UNK-0 
 what is it for ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 turned his pale face to stephen and said UNK-982 and UNK-828 
 UNK-0 
 per UNK-653 UNK-499 . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen pointed to the UNK-830 photograph and said 
 UNK-0 
 he has the face of a UNK-114 christ . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-589 and anger in his voice brought UNK-368 eyes back from a calm 
 survey of the walls of the hall . 
 UNK-0 
 are you UNK-776 ? he asked . 
 UNK-0 
 no answered stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 are you in bad UNK-179 ? 
 UNK-0 
 no . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-391 ut UNK-989 UNK-191 UNK-414 UNK-62 said UNK-12 UNK-328 UNK-497 
 UNK-295 UNK-818 ut UNK-989 in UNK-852 UNK-821 UNK-581 UNK-62 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-916 on his way to the table said in UNK-8 ear 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-595 is in UNK-648 form . ready to shed the last drop . brand new 
 world . no UNK-229 and votes for the UNK-898 . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-24 at the manner of this confidence and when UNK-916 had 
 passed turned again to meet UNK-368 eyes . 
 UNK-0 
 perhaps you can tell me he said why he UNK-108 his soul so freely 
 into my ear . can you ? 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-66 UNK-290 appeared on UNK-368 UNK-133 . he UNK-156 at the table 
 where UNK-916 had bent to write his name on the roll and then said 
 UNK-692 
 UNK-0 
 a sugar ! 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-301 est in UNK-821 UNK-581 said stephen UNK-414 UNK-313 UNK-989 ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 did not take up the UNK-336 . he UNK-444 UNK-355 on his UNK-623 
 and repeated with the same flat force 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-600 bloody sugar thats what he is ! 
 UNK-0 
 it was his UNK-115 for all dead UNK-156 and stephen UNK-105 
 whether it would ever be spoken in the same tone over his memory . the 
 heavy UNK-866 phrase UNK-443 slowly out of hearing like a stone through a 
 UNK-886 . stephen saw it sink as he had seen many another feeling its 
 UNK-786 UNK-119 his heart . UNK-368 speech unlike that of UNK-232 had 
 neither rare phrases of UNK-170 english nor UNK-149 turned 
 versions of irish UNK-100 . its UNK-435 was an echo of the UNK-719 of dublin 
 given back by a UNK-55 UNK-470 UNK-642 its energy an echo of the 
 sacred UNK-118 of dublin given back UNK-692 by a UNK-777 UNK-544 . 
 UNK-0 
 the heavy UNK-290 UNK-238 from UNK-368 face as UNK-595 UNK-982 UNK-587 
 towards them from the other side of the hall . 
 UNK-0 
 here you are ! said UNK-595 UNK-200 . 
 UNK-0 
 here i am ! said stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 late as usual . can you not combine the progressive UNK-271 with a 
 respect for UNK-979 ? 
 UNK-0 
 that question is out of order said stephen . next business . 
 UNK-0 
 his UNK-21 eyes were fixed on a UNK-771 tablet of milk chocolate 
 which UNK-374 out of the UNK-948 UNK-738 . a little ring of 
 UNK-797 closed round to hear the war of UNK-115 . a lean student with 
 olive skin and UNK-987 black hair UNK-243 his face between the two UNK-220 
 from one to the other at each phrase and UNK-666 to try to catch each 
 flying phrase in his open UNK-295 mouth . UNK-12 took a small grey UNK-726 
 from his pocket and began to examine it closely turning it over and over . 
 UNK-0 
 next business ? said UNK-595 . UNK-955 ! 
 UNK-0 
 he gave a loud UNK-766 of UNK-31 UNK-24 UNK-839 and UNK-363 twice at 
 the UNK-354 UNK-297 which hung from his UNK-436 UNK-333 . 
 UNK-0 
 the next business is to sign the UNK-516 . 
 UNK-0 
 will you pay me anything if i sign ? asked stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 i thought you were an UNK-988 said UNK-595 . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-329 student looked about him and addressed the UNK-441 in 
 an UNK-398 UNK-159 voice . 
 UNK-0 
 by hell thats a UNK-81 notion . i consider that notion to be a 
 UNK-441 notion . 
 UNK-0 
 his voice UNK-238 into silence . no UNK-343 was paid to his words . he turned 
 his olive face UNK-762 in expression towards stephen UNK-207 him to 
 speak again . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-595 began to speak with UNK-301 energy of the UNK-830 UNK-735 of 
 UNK-836 of general UNK-379 arbitration in cases of international 
 disputes of the signs of the times of the new humanity and the new 
 gospel of life which would make it the business of the community to 
 secure as UNK-144 as possible the greatest possible happiness of the 
 greatest possible number . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-231 student responded to the close of the period by UNK-273 
 UNK-0 
 three cheers for universal UNK-219 ! 
 UNK-0 
 go on temple said a UNK-98 UNK-259 student near him . ill stand you a 
 UNK-395 after . 
 UNK-0 
 im a UNK-563 in universal UNK-219 said temple UNK-220 about 
 him out of his dark oval eyes . UNK-81 is only a bloody cod . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 UNK-61 his arm UNK-651 to check his tongue UNK-21 UNK-523 
 and repeated 
 UNK-0 
 easy easy easy ! 
 UNK-0 
 temple UNK-250 to free his arm but continued his mouth UNK-290 by a 
 thin foam 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-211 was founded by an UNK-843 and the first man in europe who 
 UNK-782 the freedom of thought was collins . two hundred years ago . he 
 UNK-59 UNK-233 the UNK-499 of UNK-778 . three cheers for 
 john anthony collins ! 
 UNK-0 
 a thin voice from the UNK-762 of the ring replied 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-585 ! UNK-585 ! 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-916 UNK-203 beside UNK-8 ear 
 UNK-0 
 and what about john UNK-419 poor little sister 
 UNK-0

 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-19 you UNK-320 UNK-545 her yours ? 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-20 and UNK-916 pleased with the result UNK-203 again 
 UNK-0 
 well have five bob each way on john anthony collins . 
 UNK-0 
 i am waiting for your answer said UNK-595 briefly . 
 UNK-0 
 the affair UNK-55 interest me in the least said stephen UNK-853 . 
 you know that well . why do you make a scene about it ? 
 UNK-0 
 good ! said UNK-595 UNK-463 his lips . you are a UNK-278 then ? 
 UNK-0 
 do you think you UNK-907 me stephen asked when you UNK-588 your 
 wooden sword ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-824 ! said UNK-595 UNK-770 . come to facts . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-134 and turned aside . UNK-595 stood his ground and said with 
 UNK-719 UNK-179 
 UNK-0 
 minor UNK-485 i suppose are above such UNK-168 questions as the 
 question of universal peace . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 raised his head and held the UNK-726 between the two students 
 by way of a UNK-490 saying 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-653 super UNK-409 UNK-957 UNK-473 . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen moving away the UNK-718 UNK-318 his shoulder UNK-551 in the 
 direction of the UNK-830 image saying 
 UNK-0 
 keep your icon . if we must have a jesus let us have a legitimate 
 jesus . 
 UNK-0 
 by hell thats a good one ! said the UNK-231 student to those about 
 him thats a fine expression . i like that expression UNK-172 . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-691 down the UNK-976 in his throat as if he were UNK-866 down the 
 phrase and UNK-480 at the peak of his UNK-216 cap turned to stephen 
 saying 
 UNK-0 
 excuse me sir what do you mean by that expression you UNK-420 just 
 now ? 
 UNK-0 
 feeling himself UNK-237 by the students near him he said to them 
 UNK-0 
 i am curious to know now what he meant by that expression . 
 UNK-0 
 he turned again to stephen and said in a UNK-365 
 UNK-0 
 do you believe in jesus ? i believe in man . of course i dont know 
 if you believe in man . i UNK-859 you sir . i UNK-859 the mind of man 
 independent of all religions . is that your opinion about the mind of 
 jesus ? 
 UNK-0 
 go on temple said the UNK-98 UNK-259 student returning as was his 
 UNK-19 to his first idea that UNK-395 is waiting for you . 
 UNK-0 
 he thinks im an UNK-379 temple explained to stephen because im a 
 UNK-563 in the power of mind . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 linked his arms into those of stephen and his UNK-56 and said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-209 ad UNK-210 UNK-389 UNK-749 . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen in the act of being led away caught sight of UNK-20 
 UNK-327 UNK-400 face . 
 UNK-0 
 my signature is of no account he said UNK-269 . you are right to go 
 your way . leave me to go mine . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-1 said UNK-595 UNK-252 i believe UNK-14 a good fellow but 
 you have yet to learn the UNK-491 of UNK-874 and the responsibility of 
 the human individual . 
 UNK-0 
 a voice said 
 UNK-0 
 intellectual UNK-134 is better out of this movement than in it . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-662 the UNK-142 tone of UNK-38 voice did not turn 
 in the direction of the voice . UNK-12 pushed UNK-505 through the 
 UNK-352 of students linking stephen and temple like a UNK-947 
 attended by his ministers on his way to the UNK-92 . 
 UNK-0 
 temple bent UNK-433 across UNK-368 breast and said 
 UNK-0 
 did you hear UNK-899 what he said ? that youth is UNK-528 of you . 
 did you see that ? i bet UNK-12 UNK-3 see that . by hell i saw that at 
 once . 
 UNK-0 
 as they UNK-112 the inner hall the dean of studies was in the act of 
 UNK-817 from the student with whom he had been UNK-371 . he stood at 
 the foot of the UNK-116 a foot on the lowest step his UNK-813 
 UNK-825 gathered about him for the UNK-215 with UNK-298 care UNK-278 
 his head often and UNK-598 
 UNK-0 
 not a doubt of it mr UNK-369 ! very fine ! not a doubt of it ! 
 UNK-0 
 in the middle of the hall the UNK-89 of the college UNK-173 was 
 speaking UNK-519 in a soft UNK-478 voice with a UNK-135 . as he 
 spoke he UNK-623 a little his UNK-977 UNK-195 and bit between his 
 phrases at a tiny bone pencil . 
 UNK-0 
 i hope the UNK-457 men will all come . the first arts men are pretty 
 sure . second arts too . we must make sure of the UNK-403 . 
 UNK-0 
 temple bent again across UNK-12 as they were passing through the 
 UNK-102 and said in a swift UNK-365 
 UNK-0 
 do you know that he is a married man ? he was a married man before 
 they converted him . he has a wife and children somewhere . by hell i 
 think thats the UNK-438 notion i ever heard ! eh ? 
 UNK-0 
 his UNK-365 UNK-892 off into UNK-147 UNK-204 UNK-31 . the moment they 
 were through the UNK-102 UNK-12 UNK-457 him UNK-394 by the neck and UNK-35 
 him saying 
 UNK-0 
 you UNK-600 UNK-621 fool ! ill take my dying bible there UNK-50 a 
 bigger bloody UNK-292 do you know than you in the whole UNK-600 bloody 
 world ! 
 UNK-0 
 temple UNK-948 in his grip laughing still with UNK-147 content while 
 UNK-12 repeated UNK-692 at every UNK-292 shake 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-600 UNK-611 bloody UNK-818 ! 
 UNK-0 
 they UNK-112 the UNK-967 garden together . the president wrapped in a 
 heavy loose UNK-382 was coming towards them along one of the walks 
 reading his office . at the end of the walk he UNK-46 before turning and 
 raised his eyes . the students UNK-276 temple UNK-480 as before at the 
 peak of his cap . they walked forward in silence . as they UNK-380 the 
 UNK-270 stephen could hear the UNK-135 of the players hands and the wet 
 UNK-260 of the ball and UNK-962 voice UNK-273 out UNK-92 at each 
 stroke . 
 UNK-0 
 the three students UNK-46 round the box on which UNK-232 sat to follow 
 the game . temple after a few moments UNK-284 across to stephen and 
 said 
 UNK-0 
 excuse me i wanted to ask you do you believe that UNK-201 
 UNK-965 was a UNK-63 man ? 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-20 UNK-366 . UNK-12 picking up the broken UNK-328 of a UNK-755 
 from the grass at his feet turned UNK-171 and said UNK-867 
 UNK-0 
 temple i declare to the living god if you say another word do you 
 know to anybody on any subject ill kill you super UNK-22 . 
 UNK-0 
 he was like you i fancy said stephen an emotional man . 
 UNK-0 
 blast him UNK-217 him ! said UNK-12 UNK-839 . dont talk to him at all . 
 sure you might as well be talking do you know to a UNK-600 
 UNK-453 as talking to temple . go home temple . for gods sake go 
 home . 
 UNK-0 
 i dont care a damn about you UNK-12 answered temple moving out of 
 reach of the UNK-387 UNK-328 and pointing at stephen . UNK-2 the only man 
 i see in this institution that has an individual mind . 
 UNK-0 
 institution ! individual ! UNK-5 UNK-12 . go home blast you for 
 UNK-14 a UNK-172 bloody man . 
 UNK-0 
 im an emotional man said temple . thats quite UNK-793 expressed . 
 and im proud that im an UNK-478 . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-284 out of the UNK-270 UNK-21 UNK-899 . UNK-12 watched him with a 
 blank UNK-525 face . 
 UNK-0 
 look at him ! he said . did you ever see such a UNK-60 ? 
 UNK-0 
 his phrase was UNK-593 by a strange laugh from a student who UNK-510 
 against the wall his UNK-365 cap down on his eyes . the laugh UNK-199 
 in a high key and coming from a so UNK-241 frame seemed like the 
 UNK-518 of an elephant . the students body UNK-35 all over and to ease 
 his UNK-899 he UNK-866 both his hands UNK-796 over his UNK-828 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-15 is UNK-340 said UNK-12 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-15 for answer UNK-195 himself and UNK-243 forward his chest . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-15 puts out his chest said stephen as a criticism of life . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-15 UNK-245 himself UNK-84 on the chest and said 
 UNK-0 
 who has anything to say about my UNK-847 ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 took him at the word and the two began to UNK-725 . when their 
 faces had UNK-327 with the struggle they drew apart UNK-572 . stephen 
 bent down towards UNK-232 who intent on the game had paid no UNK-343 to 
 the talk of the others . 
 UNK-0 
 and how is my little UNK-560 UNK-583 ? he asked . did he sign too ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-232 UNK-146 and said 
 UNK-0 
 and you UNK-660 ? 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-35 his head . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-14 a terrible man UNK-660 said UNK-232 taking the short pipe 
 from his mouth always alone . 
 UNK-0 
 now that you have signed the petition for universal peace said 
 stephen i suppose you will burn that little UNK-721 i saw in your 
 room . 
 UNK-0 
 as UNK-232 did not answer stephen began to quote 
 UNK-0 
 long pace UNK-85 ! right UNK-284 UNK-85 ! UNK-85 by numbers 
 UNK-465 one two ! 
 UNK-0 
 thats a different question said UNK-232 . im an irish UNK-551 
 first and UNK-533 . but thats you all out . UNK-14 a born UNK-578 
 UNK-660 . 
 UNK-0 
 when you make the next UNK-693 with UNK-817 said stephen 
 and want the UNK-548 UNK-780 tell me . i can find you a few in 
 this college . 
 UNK-0 
 i cant understand you said UNK-232 . one time i hear you talk against 
 english literature . now you talk against the irish UNK-453 . what with 
 your name and your UNK-401 you irish at all ? 
 UNK-0 
 come with me now to the office of arms and i will show you the tree 
 of my family said stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 then be one of us said UNK-232 . why dont you learn irish ? why did you 
 drop out of the league class after the first lesson ? 
 UNK-0 
 you know one reason why answered stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-232 UNK-481 his head and UNK-20 . 
 UNK-0 
 oh come now he said . is it on account of that certain young lady 
 and father UNK-713 ? but thats all in your own mind UNK-660 . they were 
 only talking and laughing . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-214 and laid a friendly hand upon UNK-962 shoulder . 
 UNK-0 
 do you remember he said when we knew each other first ? the first 
 morning we met you asked me to show you the way to the UNK-851 
 class putting a very strong stress on the first UNK-758 . you 
 remember ? then you used to address the UNK-517 as father you remember ? 
 i ask myself about you is he as innocent as his speech ? 
 UNK-0 
 im a simple person said UNK-232 . you know that . when you told me 
 that night in UNK-164 street those things about your private life 
 honest to god UNK-660 i was not able to eat my dinner . i was quite 
 bad . i was UNK-340 a long time that night . why did you tell me those 
 things ? 
 UNK-0 
 thanks said stephen . you mean i am a monster . 
 UNK-0 
 no said UNK-232 . but i wish you had not told me . 
 UNK-0 
 a tide began to surge beneath the calm surface of UNK-8 
 UNK-99 . 
 UNK-0 
 this race and this country and this life produced me he said . i 
 shall express myself as i am . 
 UNK-0 
 try to be one of us repeated UNK-232 . in heart you are an irish man 
 but your pride is too powerful . 
 UNK-0 
 my UNK-309 UNK-163 off their language and took another stephen said . 
 they allowed a UNK-335 of UNK-80 to subject them . do you fancy i am 
 going to pay in my own life and person UNK-864 they made ? what for ? 
 UNK-0 
 for our freedom said UNK-232 . 
 UNK-0 
 no UNK-176 and UNK-63 man said stephen has given up to you his 
 life and his youth and his UNK-294 from the days of tone to those of 
 UNK-121 but you sold him to the enemy or failed him in need or UNK-874 
 him and left him for another . and you invite me to be one of you . id 
 see you UNK-100 first . 
 UNK-0 
 they died for their UNK-8 UNK-660 said UNK-232 . our day will come 
 yet believe me . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen following his own thought was silent for an instant . 
 UNK-0 
 the soul is born he said UNK-489 first in those moments i told you 
 of . it has a slow and dark birth more mysterious than the birth of the 
 body . when the soul of a man is born in this country there are UNK-847 
 UNK-168 at it to hold it back from flight . you talk to me of UNK-472 
 language religion . i shall try to fly by those UNK-847 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-232 UNK-442 the UNK-460 from his pipe . 
 UNK-0 
 too deep for me UNK-660 he said . but a UNK-54 country comes first . 
 ireland first UNK-660 . you can be a poet or a UNK-185 after . 
 UNK-0 
 do you know what ireland is ? asked stephen with cold violence . 
 ireland is the old UNK-840 that UNK-379 her UNK-948 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-232 rose from his box and went towards the players UNK-144 his head 
 UNK-542 . but in a moment his UNK-750 left him and he was UNK-25 UNK-416 
 with UNK-12 and the two players who had finished their game . a match of 
 four was arranged UNK-12 UNK-954 however that his ball should be 
 used . he let it rebound twice or UNK-697 to his hand and struck it strongly 
 and UNK-171 towards the base of the UNK-270 UNK-963 in answer to its 
 UNK-99 
 UNK-0 
 your soul ! 
 UNK-0 
 stephen stood with UNK-15 till the score began to rise . then he UNK-347 
 him by the sleeve to come away . UNK-15 UNK-759 saying 
 UNK-0 
 let us UNK-49 go as UNK-12 has it . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-24 at this UNK-680 . 
 UNK-0 
 they passed back through the garden and out through the hall where the 
 UNK-955 porter was UNK-855 up a hall notice in the frame . at the foot 
 of the steps they UNK-46 and stephen took a packet of cigarettes from 
 his pocket and offered it to his companion . 
 UNK-0 
 i know you are poor he said . 
 UNK-0 
 damn your yellow UNK-651 answered UNK-15 . 
 UNK-0 
 this second proof of UNK-179 culture made stephen smile again . 
 UNK-0 
 it was a great day for european culture he said when you made up 
 your mind to UNK-425 in yellow . 
 UNK-0 
 they lit their cigarettes and turned to the right . after a UNK-242 
 stephen began 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-613 has not defined UNK-47 and terror . i have . i say 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-15 UNK-46 and said UNK-770 
 UNK-0 
 stop ! i UNK-19 listen ! i am sick . i was out last night on a yellow 
 drunk with UNK-849 and UNK-235 . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen went on 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-47 is the feeling which UNK-512 the mind in the presence of 
 UNK-303 is grave and constant in human UNK-346 and UNK-957 it with 
 the human UNK-952 . terror is the feeling which UNK-512 the mind in the 
 presence of UNK-303 is grave and constant in human UNK-346 and 
 UNK-957 it with the secret cause . 
 UNK-0 
 repeat said UNK-15 . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen repeated the definitions slowly . 
 UNK-0 
 a girl got into a UNK-986 a few days ago he went on in london . she 
 was on her way to meet her mother whom she had not seen for many years . 
 at the corner of a street the shaft of a UNK-674 UNK-364 the window of 
 the UNK-986 in the shape of a star . a long fine needle of the UNK-364 
 glass UNK-650 her heart . she died on the instant . the reporter called 
 it a UNK-472 death . it is not . it is remote from terror and UNK-47 
 according to the terms of my definitions . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-472 UNK-370 in fact is a face looking two ways towards 
 terror and towards UNK-47 both of which are phases of it . you see i use 
 the word arrest . i mean that the UNK-472 UNK-370 is static . or rather 
 the dramatic UNK-370 is . the feelings excited by UNK-16 art are 
 UNK-229 desire or UNK-820 . desire UNK-549 us to possess to go to 
 something UNK-820 UNK-549 us to UNK-665 to go from something . the arts 
 which UNK-333 them UNK-117 or UNK-522 are therefore UNK-16 
 arts . the UNK-175 UNK-370 i used the general term is therefore 
 static . the mind is arrested and raised above desire and UNK-820 . 
 UNK-0 
 you say that art must not UNK-333 desire said UNK-15 . i told you that 
 one day i wrote my name in pencil on the UNK-830 of the UNK-447 of 
 UNK-569 in the museum . was that not desire ? 
 UNK-0 
 i speak of normal UNK-978 said stephen . you also told me that when 
 you were a boy in that charming UNK-661 school you ate pieces of 
 dried UNK-495 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-15 broke again into a UNK-518 of UNK-31 and again UNK-866 both his 
 hands over his UNK-828 but without taking them from his pockets . 
 UNK-0 
 o i did ! i did ! he UNK-5 . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen turned towards his companion and looked at him for a moment 
 UNK-258 in the eyes . UNK-15 UNK-193 from his UNK-31 answered his 
 look from his UNK-558 eyes . the long UNK-293 UNK-539 UNK-241 beneath 
 the long pointed cap brought before UNK-8 mind the image of a 
 UNK-226 UNK-297 . the eyes too were UNK-632 in UNK-88 and UNK-49 . yet 
 at that instant UNK-558 and alert in their look they were lit by one 
 tiny human point the window of a UNK-421 soul UNK-269 and 
 UNK-732 . 
 UNK-0 
 as for that stephen said in UNK-727 UNK-155 we are all animals . 
 i also am an animal . 
 UNK-0 
 you are said UNK-15 . 
 UNK-0 
 but we are just now in a mental world stephen continued . the desire 
 and UNK-820 excited by UNK-16 UNK-175 means are really not UNK-175 
 emotions not only because they are UNK-229 in character but also 
 because they are not more than physical . our flesh UNK-472 from what it 
 UNK-599 and UNK-355 to the UNK-301 of what it UNK-46 by a UNK-7 
 UNK-486 action of the nervous system . our UNK-777 closes before we are 
 aware that the fly is about to enter our eye . 
 UNK-0 
 not always said UNK-15 UNK-383 . 
 UNK-0 
 in the same way said stephen your flesh responded to the UNK-301 
 of a naked UNK-287 but it was i say simply a UNK-486 action of the 
 UNK-510 . beauty expressed by the artist UNK-216 UNK-36 in us an UNK-370 
 which is UNK-229 or a UNK-393 which is UNK-7 physical . it UNK-633 
 or ought to UNK-36 or UNK-582 or ought to UNK-602 an UNK-175 UNK-843 
 an ideal UNK-47 or an ideal terror a UNK-843 called forth UNK-609 and 
 at last UNK-638 by what i call the rhythm of beauty . 
 UNK-0 
 what is that exactly ? asked UNK-15 . 
 UNK-0 
 rhythm said stephen is the first formal UNK-175 relation of part 
 to part in any UNK-175 whole or of an UNK-175 whole to its part or 
 parts or of any part to the UNK-175 whole of which it is a part . 
 UNK-0 
 if that is rhythm said UNK-15 let me hear what you call beauty 
 and please remember though i did eat a cake of UNK-495 once that i 
 UNK-859 only beauty . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen raised his cap as if in greeting . then UNK-521 slightly he 
 laid his hand on UNK-179 thick UNK-216 sleeve . 
 UNK-0 
 we are right he said and the others are wrong . to speak of these 
 things and to try to understand their nature and having understood it 
 to try slowly and UNK-970 and constantly to express to press out again 
 from the gross earth or what it brings forth from sound and shape and 
 colour which are the prison gates of our soul an image of the beauty 
 we have come to UNK-257 is art . 
 UNK-0 
 they had reached the canal bridge and turning from their course went 
 on by the trees . a crude grey light UNK-828 in the UNK-336 water and 
 a smell of wet branches over their heads seemed to war against the 
 course of UNK-8 thought . 
 UNK-0 
 but you have not answered my question said UNK-15 . what is art ? what 
 is the beauty it UNK-859 ? 
 UNK-0 
 that was the first definition i gave you you UNK-805 UNK-208 
 said stephen when i began to try to think out the matter for myself . 
 do you remember the night ? UNK-12 lost his UNK-933 and began to talk 
 about UNK-777 bacon . 
 UNK-0 
 i remember said UNK-15 . he told us about them UNK-600 fat UNK-268 of 
 UNK-380 . 
 UNK-0 
 art said stephen is the human disposition of UNK-629 or 
 UNK-906 matter for an UNK-175 end . you remember the UNK-380 and 
 forget that . you are a UNK-394 pair you and UNK-12 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-15 made a UNK-782 at the raw grey sky and said 
 UNK-0 
 if i am to listen to your UNK-175 philosophy give me at least 
 another cigarette . i dont care about it . i dont even care about 
 women . damn you and damn everything . i want a job of five hundred a 
 year . you cant get me one . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen handed him the packet of cigarettes . UNK-15 took the last one 
 that remained saying simply 
 UNK-0 
 proceed ! 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-582 said stephen says that is beautiful the UNK-959 of 
 which UNK-388 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-15 UNK-146 . 
 UNK-0 
 i remember that he said UNK-886 UNK-767 UNK-760 visa UNK-777 . 
 UNK-0 
 he uses the word visa said stephen to cover UNK-175 UNK-451 of 
 all kinds whether through sight or hearing or through any other avenue of 
 UNK-959 . this word though it is UNK-209 is clear enough to keep 
 away good and evil which UNK-333 desire and UNK-820 . it means certainly 
 a UNK-843 and not a UNK-778 . how about the true ? it produces also a 
 UNK-843 of the mind . you would not write your name in pencil across the 
 UNK-206 of a UNK-165 triangle . 
 UNK-0 
 no said UNK-15 give me the UNK-206 of the UNK-447 of UNK-569 . 
 UNK-0 
 static therefore said stephen . UNK-106 i believe said that beauty 
 is the UNK-69 of truth . i dont think that it has a meaning but the 
 true and the beautiful are UNK-278 . truth is UNK-809 by the UNK-678 which 
 is UNK-709 by the most UNK-269 relations of the UNK-906 
 beauty is UNK-809 by the imagination which is UNK-709 by the most 
 UNK-269 relations of the UNK-629 . the first step in the direction 
 of truth is to understand the frame and scope of the UNK-678 itself 
 to UNK-844 the act itself of UNK-464 . UNK-169 entire system 
 of philosophy UNK-765 upon his book of psychology and that i think 
 UNK-765 on his statement that the same attribute UNK-216 at the same time 
 and in the same UNK-0 belong to and not belong to the same subject . 
 the first step in the direction of beauty is to understand the frame 
 and scope of the imagination to UNK-844 the act itself of UNK-175 
 UNK-959 . is that clear ? 
 UNK-0 
 but what is beauty ? asked UNK-15 UNK-782 . out with another 
 definition . something we see and like ! is that the best you and UNK-582 
 can do ? 
 UNK-0 
 let us take woman said stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 let us take her ! said UNK-15 UNK-717 . 
 UNK-0 
 the greek the UNK-181 the chinese the UNK-841 the UNK-33 said 
 stephen all UNK-859 a different type of female beauty . that seems 
 to be a UNK-39 out of which we UNK-216 escape . i see however 
 two ways out . one is this hypothesis that every physical quality 
 UNK-336 by men in women is in direct UNK-0 with the UNK-101 
 functions of women for the UNK-618 of the species . it may be so . 
 the world it seems is UNK-764 than even you UNK-15 UNK-747 . for my 
 part i UNK-279 that way out . it leads to UNK-212 rather than to 
 UNK-175 . it leads you out of the UNK-39 into a new UNK-959 UNK-41 
 where UNK-595 with one hand on the origin of species and the other hand 
 on the new testament tells you that you UNK-336 the great UNK-722 of 
 UNK-447 because you felt that she would bear you UNK-548 UNK-598 and 
 UNK-336 her great breasts because you felt that she would give good 
 milk to her children and yours . 
 UNK-0 
 then UNK-595 is a UNK-318 UNK-328 said UNK-15 UNK-815 . 
 UNK-0 
 there remains another way out said stephen laughing . 
 UNK-0 
 to wit ? said UNK-15 . 
 UNK-0 
 this hypothesis stephen began . 
 UNK-0 
 a long UNK-260 laden with old iron came round the corner of sir patrick 
 UNK-888 hospital covering the end of UNK-8 speech with the UNK-142 UNK-612 
 of UNK-998 and UNK-437 metal . UNK-15 closed his ears and gave out UNK-19 
 after UNK-19 till the UNK-260 had passed . then he turned on his heel UNK-394 . 
 stephen turned also and UNK-56 for a few moments till his UNK-193 
 UNK-781 had had its UNK-662 . 
 UNK-0 
 this hypothesis stephen repeated is the other way out that 
 though the same object may not seem beautiful to all people all people 
 who UNK-859 a beautiful object find in it certain relations which 
 satisfy and UNK-893 with the stages themselves of all UNK-175 
 UNK-959 . these relations of the UNK-629 visible to you through 
 one form and to me through another must be therefore the necessary 
 qualities of beauty . now we can return to our old friend saint thomas 
 for another UNK-240 of wisdom . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-15 UNK-20 . 
 UNK-0 
 it UNK-532 me UNK-283 he said to hear you UNK-309 him time after 
 time like a UNK-236 round UNK-537 . are you laughing in your sleeve ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-899 answered stephen would call my UNK-175 theory applied 
 UNK-582 . so far as this side of UNK-175 philosophy extends UNK-582 
 will carry me all along the line . when we come to the UNK-219 of 
 artistic UNK-991 artistic UNK-314 and artistic reproduction i 
 require a new terminology and a new personal experience . 
 UNK-0 
 of course said UNK-15 . after all UNK-582 in UNK-300 of his UNK-678 
 was exactly a good round UNK-537 . but you will tell me about the new 
 personal experience and new terminology some other day . UNK-282 up and 
 finish the first part . 
 UNK-0 
 who knows ? said stephen UNK-21 . perhaps UNK-582 would understand 
 me better than you . he was a poet himself . he wrote a UNK-369 for UNK-79 
 thursday . it begins with the words UNK-469 UNK-380 UNK-759 . they say it 
 is the highest glory of the UNK-374 . it is an UNK-49 and UNK-365 
 UNK-369 . i like it but there is no UNK-369 that can be put beside that 
 UNK-938 and UNK-107 UNK-20 song the UNK-755 UNK-390 of UNK-574 
 UNK-8 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-15 began to sing UNK-41 and UNK-505 in a deep bass voice 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-565 UNK-767 UNK-760 UNK-364 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  david UNK-60 UNK-586 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-177 UNK-811 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-117 a UNK-51 UNK-237 . 
 UNK-0 
 thats great ! he said well pleased . great music ! 
 UNK-0 
 they turned into lower mount street . a few steps from the corner a fat 
 young man wearing a silk UNK-866 UNK-276 them and stopped . 
 UNK-0 
 did you hear the results of the exams ? he asked . griffin was 
 UNK-347 . UNK-952 and UNK-272 are through the home civil . UNK-729 got 
 fifth place in the indian . UNK-407 got UNK-618 . the irish 
 UNK-13 in UNK-713 gave them a feed last night . they all ate UNK-942 . 
 UNK-0 
 his UNK-13 UNK-614 face expressed UNK-781 UNK-953 and as he had 
 advanced through his UNK-500 of success his small UNK-18 eyes 
 UNK-134 out of sight and his weak UNK-793 voice out of hearing . 
 UNK-0 
 in reply to a question of UNK-8 his eyes and his voice came forth 
 again from their UNK-908 . 
 UNK-0 
 yes UNK-398 and i he said . UNK-2 taking pure mathematics and im 
 taking constitutional history . there are twenty subjects . im taking 
 UNK-566 too . you know im a member of the field club . 
 UNK-0 
 he drew back from the other two in a UNK-196 fashion and placed a UNK-191 
 UNK-639 hand on his breast from which UNK-606 UNK-793 UNK-31 
 at once broke forth . 
 UNK-0 
 bring us a few UNK-755 and UNK-538 the next time you go out said 
 stephen UNK-54 to make a UNK-773 . 
 UNK-0 
 the fat student UNK-20 UNK-834 and said 
 UNK-0 
 we are all highly UNK-667 people in the field club . last 
 saturday we went out to UNK-121 seven of us . 
 UNK-0 
 with women UNK-452 ? said UNK-15 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-452 again laid his hand on his chest and said 
 UNK-0 
 our end is the acquisition of knowledge . then he said quickly 
 UNK-0 
 i hear you are writing some essays about UNK-330 . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen made a UNK-209 UNK-359 of denial . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-809 and UNK-211 said UNK-452 have written a lot on that 
 subject the classical school and the romantic school and all that . the 
 UNK-101 interested me very much when i read it . of course it is 
 UNK-510 german UNK-199 . 
 UNK-0 
 neither of the others spoke . UNK-452 took leave of them UNK-755 . 
 UNK-0 
 i must go he said UNK-41 and UNK-791 i have a strong 
 UNK-488 UNK-811 almost to a conviction that my sister intended to 
 make UNK-168 today for the dinner of the UNK-452 family . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-244 stephen said in his wake . dont forget the UNK-755 for me 
 and my mate . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-15 UNK-84 after him his lip UNK-556 in slow UNK-589 till his face 
 UNK-670 a UNK-268 mask 
 UNK-0 
 to think that that yellow UNK-97 UNK-337 can get a good 
 job he said at length and i have to smoke cheap cigarettes ! 
 UNK-0 
 they turned their faces towards UNK-802 square and went for a little in 
 silence . 
 UNK-0 
 to finish what i was saying about beauty said stephen the most 
 UNK-269 relations of the UNK-629 must therefore UNK-610 to the 
 necessary phases of artistic UNK-959 . find these and you find the 
 qualities of universal beauty . UNK-582 says ad UNK-866 UNK-922 
 UNK-525 UNK-413 UNK-426 UNK-199 . i translate it so three 
 things are needed for beauty UNK-527 harmony and UNK-102 . do 
 these UNK-610 to the phases of UNK-959 ? are you following ? 
 UNK-0 
 of course i am said UNK-15 . if you think i have an UNK-795 
 intelligence run after UNK-452 and ask him to listen to you . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen pointed to a basket which a UNK-754 boy had UNK-34 UNK-132 on 
 his head . 
 UNK-0 
 look at that basket he said . 
 UNK-0 
 i see it said UNK-15 . 
 UNK-0 
 in order to see that basket said stephen your mind first of all 
 UNK-258 the basket from the rest of the visible universe which is not 
 the basket . the first phase of UNK-959 is a UNK-295 line drawn 
 about the object to be UNK-943 . an UNK-175 image is presented to 
 us either in space or in time . 
 UNK-0 
 what is UNK-557 is presented in time what is visible is presented in 
 space . but temporal or spatial the UNK-175 image is first UNK-638 
 UNK-943 as UNK-29 and UNK-409 upon the UNK-331 
 background of space or time which is not it . you UNK-943 it as one 
 thing . you see it as one whole . you UNK-702 its UNK-527 . that is 
 UNK-413 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-988 eye ! said UNK-15 laughing . go on . 
 UNK-0 
 then said stephen you pass from point to point led by its formal 
 lines you UNK-702 it as balanced part against part within its 
 limits you feel the rhythm of its structure . in other words the 
 synthesis of immediate perception is followed by the analysis of 
 UNK-959 . having first felt that it is one thing you feel now that 
 it is a thing . you UNK-702 it as complex multiple UNK-114 
 UNK-181 made up of its parts the result of its parts and their sum 
 UNK-975 . that is UNK-426 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-988 eye again ! said UNK-15 UNK-780 . tell me now what is UNK-199 
 and you win the UNK-455 . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-669 of the word stephen said is rather UNK-209 . UNK-582 
 uses a term which seems to be UNK-131 . it UNK-25 me for a long time . 
 it would lead you to believe that he had in mind UNK-781 or UNK-157 
 the supreme quality of beauty being a light from some other world the 
 idea of which the matter is but the shadow the reality of which it is 
 but the symbol . i thought he might mean that UNK-199 is the artistic 
 discovery and representation of the divine purpose in anything or a 
 force of UNK-832 which would make the UNK-175 image a 
 universal one make it UNK-118 its proper conditions . but that is 
 literary talk . i understand it so . when you have UNK-943 that 
 basket as one thing and have then UNK-307 it according to its form and 
 UNK-943 it as a thing you make the only synthesis which is 
 UNK-983 and UNK-95 UNK-707 . you see that it is that thing 
 which it is and no other thing . the UNK-102 of which he speaks in the 
 UNK-156 UNK-359 the UNK-92 of a thing . this supreme quality is 
 felt by the artist when the UNK-175 image is first UNK-290 in his 
 imagination . the mind in that mysterious instant UNK-838 UNK-497 
 beautifully to a UNK-546 coal . the instant UNK-700 that supreme quality 
 of beauty the clear UNK-102 of the UNK-175 image is UNK-943 
 UNK-638 by the mind which has been arrested by its UNK-527 and 
 UNK-160 by its harmony is the UNK-915 silent UNK-843 of UNK-175 
 pleasure a spiritual state very like to that cardiac condition which 
 the italian UNK-146 UNK-355 UNK-242 using a phrase almost as 
 beautiful as UNK-374 called the UNK-555 of the heart . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-214 and though his companion did not speak felt that his 
 words had called up around them a UNK-182 silence . 
 UNK-0 
 what i have said he began again refers to beauty in the wider 
 sense of the word in the sense which the word has in the literary 
 tradition . in the marketplace it has another sense . when we speak of 
 beauty in the second sense of the term our UNK-623 is influenced in 
 the first place by the art itself and by the form of that art . the 
 image it is clear must be set between the mind or UNK-344 of the 
 artist himself and the mind or UNK-344 of others . if you bear this in 
 memory you will see that art necessarily UNK-322 itself into three 
 forms UNK-692 from one to the next . these forms are the UNK-874 
 form the form UNK-700 the artist presents his image in immediate 
 relation to himself the UNK-49 form the form UNK-700 he presents his 
 image in UNK-142 relation to himself and to others the dramatic form 
 the form UNK-700 he presents his image in immediate relation to others . 
 UNK-0 
 that you told me a few nights ago said UNK-15 and we began the 
 famous discussion . 
 UNK-0 
 i have a book at home said stephen in which i have written down 
 questions which are more UNK-893 than yours were . in finding the 
 answers to them i found the theory of UNK-175 which i am trying to 
 explain . here are some questions i set myself is a chair UNK-163 made 
 UNK-472 or comic ? is the portrait of UNK-236 lisa good if i desire to see 
 it ? if not why not ? 
 UNK-0 
 why not indeed ? said UNK-15 laughing . 
 UNK-0 
 if a man UNK-461 in UNK-558 at a block of wood stephen continued make 
 there an image of a cow is that image a work of art ? if not why not ? 
 UNK-0 
 thats a lovely one said UNK-15 laughing again . that has the true 
 UNK-156 UNK-3 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-211 said stephen should not have taken a group of UNK-848 to 
 write of . the art being UNK-637 does not present the forms i spoke 
 of distinguished clearly one from another . even in literature the 
 highest and most spiritual art the forms are often confused . the 
 UNK-874 form is in fact the UNK-208 verbal UNK-585 of an instant of 
 UNK-370 a UNK-307 cry such as ages ago UNK-78 on the man who pulled 
 at the UNK-999 or UNK-867 stones up a slope . he who UNK-640 it is more 
 conscious of the instant of UNK-370 than of himself as feeling UNK-370 . 
 the UNK-208 UNK-49 form is seen emerging out of UNK-874 literature 
 when the artist UNK-891 and UNK-668 upon himself as the centre of an 
 UNK-49 event and this form UNK-39 till the centre of emotional 
 gravity is UNK-445 from the artist himself and from others . the 
 narrative is no longer UNK-7 personal . the personality of the artist 
 passes into the UNK-167 itself UNK-441 round and round the persons 
 and the action like a vital sea . this progress you will see easily in 
 that old english UNK-45 UNK-859 hero which begins in the first person 
 and ends in the third person . the dramatic form is reached when the 
 UNK-880 which has UNK-760 and UNK-216 round each person UNK-523 every 
 person with such vital force that he or she assumes a proper and 
 UNK-737 UNK-175 life . the personality of the artist at first a cry 
 or a UNK-435 or a mood and then a fluid and UNK-702 narrative finally 
 UNK-930 itself out of existence UNK-269 itself so to speak . 
 the UNK-175 image in the dramatic form is life UNK-402 in and 
 UNK-177 from the human imagination . the mystery of UNK-175 like 
 that of material creation is accomplished . the artist like the god of 
 creation remains within or behind or beyond or above his UNK-522 
 invisible refined out of existence UNK-942 UNK-537 his 
 UNK-971 . 
 UNK-0 
 trying to refine them also out of existence said UNK-15 . 
 UNK-0 
 a fine rain began to fall from the high UNK-585 sky and they turned into 
 the UNK-801 lawn to reach the national library before the shower came . 
 UNK-0 
 what do you mean UNK-15 asked UNK-740 by UNK-999 about beauty and 
 the imagination in this UNK-786 UNK-221 island ? no wonder the 
 artist retired within or behind his UNK-522 after having UNK-951 
 this country . 
 UNK-0 
 the rain fell faster . when they passed through the passage beside 
 UNK-328 house they found many students UNK-275 under the arcade of 
 the library . UNK-12 UNK-200 against a UNK-271 was picking his teeth 
 with a UNK-476 match listening to some UNK-193 . some girls stood 
 near the entrance door . UNK-15 UNK-222 to stephen 
 UNK-0 
 your UNK-506 is here . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen took his place UNK-173 on the step below the group of 
 students UNK-69 of the rain which fell fast turning his eyes 
 towards her from time to time . she too stood UNK-173 among her 
 UNK-193 . she has no priest to UNK-123 with he thought with conscious 
 UNK-321 UNK-617 how he had seen her last . UNK-15 was right . his 
 mind UNK-198 of theory and courage UNK-622 back into a UNK-826 peace . 
 UNK-0 
 he heard the students talking among themselves . they spoke of two 
 friends who had passed the final medical examination of the chances of 
 getting places on ocean UNK-800 of poor and rich practices . 
 UNK-0 
 thats all a bubble . an irish country practice is better . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-45 was two years in liverpool and he says the same . a UNK-728 
 hole he said it was . nothing but UNK-207 cases . 
 UNK-0 
 do you mean to say it is better to have a job here in the country 
 than in a rich city like that ? i know a fellow . . . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-45 has no UNK-439 . he got through by UNK-996 pure UNK-996 . 
 UNK-0 
 dont mind him . UNK-6 plenty of money to be made in a big commercial 
 city . 
 UNK-0 
 depends on the practice . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-414 UNK-391 ut UNK-123 UNK-920 est UNK-457 UNK-528 UNK-457 
 UNK-191 UNK-528 in UNK-521 . 
 UNK-0 
 their voices reached his ears as if from a distance in UNK-9 
 UNK-901 . she was preparing to go away with her UNK-193 . 
 UNK-0 
 the quick light shower had drawn off UNK-320 in clusters of diamonds 
 among the UNK-536 of the UNK-955 where an UNK-925 was UNK-98 
 forth by the UNK-73 earth . their trim boots UNK-595 as they stood 
 on the steps of the UNK-795 talking UNK-40 and UNK-219 UNK-220 at 
 the clouds holding their UNK-399 at UNK-650 UNK-349 against the few 
 last UNK-821 closing them again holding their skirts UNK-464 . 
 UNK-0 
 and if he had UNK-863 her UNK-155 ? if her life were a simple UNK-536 of 
 hours her life simple and strange as a birds life gay in the 
 morning UNK-741 all day tired at UNK-409 ? her heart simple and 
 UNK-20 as a birds heart ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 towards dawn he UNK-170 . o what sweet music ! his soul was all UNK-934 wet . 
 over his UNK-477 in sleep pale cool waves of light had passed . he lay 
 still as if his soul lay UNK-22 cool waters conscious of UNK-90 sweet 
 music . his mind was UNK-632 slowly to a UNK-993 morning knowledge a 
 morning inspiration . a spirit filled him pure as the UNK-680 water 
 sweet as UNK-826 moving as music . but how UNK-284 it was UNK-163 how 
 UNK-835 as if the UNK-222 themselves were breathing upon him ! 
 his soul was UNK-632 slowly UNK-143 to UNK-340 UNK-571 . it was that 
 UNK-615 hour of dawn when madness UNK-418 and strange plants open to the 
 light and the UNK-894 UNK-714 forth UNK-173 . 
 UNK-0 
 an UNK-555 of the heart ! the night had been UNK-610 . in a dream 
 or vision he had known the UNK-119 of UNK-293 life . was it an instant 
 of UNK-555 only or long hours and years and ages ? 
 UNK-0 
 the instant of inspiration seemed now to be reflected from all sides at 
 once from a UNK-431 of cloudy circumstances of what had happened or 
 of what might have happened . the instant UNK-179 forth like a point of 
 light and now from cloud on cloud of UNK-209 UNK-194 confused form 
 was UNK-931 UNK-41 its UNK-665 . o ! in the virgin UNK-656 of the 
 imagination the word was made flesh . gabriel the UNK-993 had come to the 
 UNK-420 chamber . an UNK-665 UNK-699 within his spirit UNK-422 the 
 white flame had passed UNK-191 to a rose and UNK-452 light . that rose 
 and UNK-452 light was her strange UNK-20 heart strange that no man had 
 known or would know UNK-20 from before the beginning of the world and 
 UNK-126 by that UNK-452 UNK-660 glow the UNK-77 of the UNK-222 were 
 falling from heaven . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  are you not UNK-129 of UNK-452 ways 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-38 of the fallen UNK-222 ? 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  tell no more of UNK-610 days . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-351 passed from his mind to his lips and UNK-289 them over 
 he felt the UNK-109 movement of a UNK-351 pass through them . the 
 UNK-660 glow sent forth its rays of UNK-64 ways days UNK-362 praise 
 raise . its rays UNK-416 up the world UNK-213 the hearts of men and 
 angels the rays from the rose that was her UNK-20 heart . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  your eyes have set UNK-54 heart UNK-703 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  and you have had your will of him . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  are you not UNK-129 of UNK-452 ways ? 
 UNK-0 
 and then ? the rhythm died away UNK-167 began again to move and beat . 
 and then ? smoke UNK-402 UNK-463 from the UNK-92 of the world . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  above the flame the smoke of praise 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  goes up from ocean rim to rim 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  tell no more of UNK-610 days . 
 UNK-0 
 smoke went up from the whole earth from the UNK-763 UNK-856 smoke of 
 her praise . the earth was like a UNK-907 UNK-223 UNK-188 a ball of 
 UNK-402 an UNK-570 fall . the rhythm died out at once the cry of 
 his heart was broken . his lips began to UNK-208 the first UNK-351 over 
 and over then went on UNK-627 through half UNK-351 UNK-833 and 
 UNK-25 then stopped . the hearts cry was broken . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-585 UNK-615 hour had passed and behind the UNK-945 of the naked 
 window the morning light was gathering . a bell beat UNK-284 very far 
 away . a bird UNK-454 two birds three . the bell and the bird UNK-167 
 and the UNK-66 white light spread itself east and west covering the 
 world covering the UNK-924 in his heart . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-143 to lose all he raised himself suddenly on his UNK-213 to look 
 for paper and pencil . there was neither on the table only the soup 
 plate he had UNK-361 the rice from for UNK-255 and the UNK-599 with 
 its UNK-34 of UNK-284 and its paper socket UNK-108 by the last flame . 
 he UNK-269 his arm UNK-853 towards the foot of the bed UNK-740 with 
 his hand in the pockets of the coat that hung there . his fingers found 
 a pencil and then a cigarette packet . he lay back and UNK-375 open the 
 packet placed the last cigarette on the window UNK-681 and began to 
 write out the UNK-805 of the UNK-351 in small UNK-522 letters on the 
 rough UNK-991 surface . 
 UNK-0 
 having written them out he lay back on the UNK-799 pillow UNK-289 them 
 again . the UNK-882 of UNK-253 UNK-275 under his head UNK-610 him of the 
 UNK-882 of UNK-253 UNK-813 in the sofa of her UNK-309 on which he used 
 to sit UNK-21 or serious asking himself why he had come UNK-494 
 with her and with himself UNK-806 by the print of the sacred heart 
 above the UNK-170 UNK-839 . he saw her approach him in a UNK-841 of 
 the talk and UNK-429 him to sing one of his curious songs . then he saw 
 himself sitting at the old piano striking UNK-362 UNK-41 from its 
 UNK-346 keys and singing UNK-22 the talk which had UNK-482 again in the 
 room to her who UNK-122 beside the UNK-425 a UNK-888 song of the 
 UNK-162 a sad and sweet UNK-426 to UNK-991 the victory UNK-223 of 
 UNK-102 the happy air of UNK-165 . while he UNK-57 and she 
 UNK-126 or UNK-987 to listen his heart was at rest but when the 
 UNK-495 old songs had ended and he heard again the voices in the room he 
 remembered his own UNK-174 the house where young men are called by 
 their christian names a little too soon . 
 UNK-0 
 at certain UNK-268 her eyes seemed about to trust him but he had 
 UNK-56 in UNK-398 . she passed now dancing UNK-79 across his memory as she 
 had been that night at the carnival ball her white dress a little 
 UNK-64 a white spray UNK-278 in her hair . she UNK-452 UNK-79 in the 
 round . she was dancing towards him and as she came her eyes were a 
 little UNK-922 and a UNK-90 glow was on her UNK-139 . at the UNK-242 in the 
 chain of hands her hand had UNK-89 in his an instant a soft merchandise . 
 UNK-0 
 you are a great stranger now . 
 UNK-0 
 yes . i was born to be a UNK-235 .

 i am afraid you are a UNK-637 . 
 UNK-0 
 are you much afraid ? 
 UNK-0 
 for answer she had UNK-452 away from him along the chain of hands 
 dancing UNK-79 and UNK-456 giving herself to none . the white spray 
 UNK-146 to her dancing and when she was in shadow the glow was deeper on 
 her UNK-139 . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-235 ! his own image started forth a UNK-213 of the UNK-308 a 
 UNK-637 UNK-369 willing and willing not to serve UNK-785 like 
 UNK-593 da UNK-727 san UNK-123 a UNK-892 web of UNK-851 and 
 UNK-387 in her ear . 
 UNK-0 
 no it was not his image . it was like the image of the young priest in 
 whose company he had seen her last looking at him out of UNK-159 eyes 
 UNK-757 with the pages of her irish UNK-78 . 
 UNK-0 
 yes yes the ladies are coming round to us . i can see it every day . 
 the ladies are with us . the best UNK-387 the language has . 
 UNK-0 
 and the church father UNK-713 ? 
 UNK-0 
 the church too . coming round too . the work is going ahead there too . 
 dont UNK-873 about the church . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-392 ! he had done well to leave the room in UNK-280 . he had done well 
 not to UNK-465 her on the steps of the library ! he had done well to 
 leave her to UNK-123 with her priest to toy with a church which was the 
 UNK-811 of UNK-336 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-292 brutal anger UNK-605 the last UNK-410 instant of UNK-119 from his 
 soul . it broke up UNK-611 her fair image and UNK-168 the UNK-504 on 
 all sides . on all sides UNK-451 reflections of her image started from 
 his memory the flower girl in the UNK-884 dress with UNK-261 UNK-997 hair 
 and a UNK-794 face who had called herself his own girl and UNK-113 his 
 UNK-307 the UNK-416 in the next house who UNK-57 over the UNK-302 
 of her plates with the UNK-435 of a country singer the first bars of by 
 UNK-13 lakes and UNK-438 a girl who had UNK-20 UNK-219 to see him 
 UNK-40 when the iron UNK-59 in the UNK-125 near cork hill had caught 
 the broken sole of his shoe a girl he had UNK-75 at UNK-57 by her 
 small ripe mouth as she passed out of UNK-413 UNK-979 factory who had 
 UNK-5 to him over her shoulder 
 UNK-0 
 do you like what you seen of me straight hair and UNK-693 UNK-993 ? 
 UNK-0 
 and yet he felt that however he might UNK-81 and UNK-896 her image his 
 anger was also a form of UNK-77 . he had left the classroom in UNK-280 
 that was not UNK-571 UNK-63 feeling that perhaps the secret of her 
 race lay behind those dark eyes upon which her long UNK-242 UNK-168 a 
 quick shadow . he had told himself UNK-828 as he walked through the 
 streets that she was a figure of the UNK-122 of her country a UNK-149 
 soul UNK-632 to the consciousness of itself in darkness and UNK-957 and 
 UNK-964 UNK-320 UNK-401 UNK-941 and UNK-422 with her mild lover and 
 leaving him to UNK-365 of innocent UNK-769 in the UNK-678 ear of a 
 priest . his anger against her found UNK-662 in UNK-997 UNK-988 at her 
 UNK-747 whose name and voice and features UNK-563 his UNK-25 pride a 
 UNK-383 UNK-720 with a brother a UNK-869 in dublin and a brother a 
 UNK-276 in UNK-600 . to him she would UNK-304 her souls UNK-523 UNK-324 to 
 one who was but UNK-837 in the UNK-69 of a formal UNK-11 rather than 
 to him a priest of the eternal imagination UNK-583 the daily bread 
 of experience into the UNK-543 body of UNK-932 life . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-543 image of the UNK-47 united again in an instant his 
 UNK-412 and UNK-432 thoughts their UNK-155 arising UNK-961 in a UNK-369 
 of thanksgiving . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  our broken UNK-155 and UNK-938 UNK-908 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  rise in one UNK-286 UNK-369 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  are you not UNK-129 of UNK-452 ways ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  while UNK-969 hands UNK-869 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  the UNK-677 UNK-441 to the UNK-233 . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  tell no more of UNK-610 days . 
 UNK-0 
 he spoke the UNK-351 UNK-736 from the first lines till the music and 
 rhythm UNK-197 his mind turning it to quiet UNK-636 then copied 
 them UNK-507 to feel them the better by seeing them then lay back on 
 his UNK-873 . 
 UNK-0 
 the full morning light had come . no sound was to be heard but he knew 
 that all around him life was about to UNK-36 in common UNK-304 UNK-445 
 voices UNK-638 prayers . UNK-318 from that life he turned towards the 
 wall making a UNK-392 of the blanket and UNK-151 at the great UNK-448 
 UNK-205 flowers of the UNK-317 wallpaper . he tried to warm his 
 UNK-161 joy in their UNK-205 glow UNK-316 a UNK-756 from where he 
 lay UNK-356 to heaven all UNK-88 with UNK-205 flowers . UNK-129 ! UNK-129 ! he 
 too was UNK-129 of UNK-452 ways . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-671 UNK-635 a UNK-359 UNK-890 passed over him descending 
 along his spine from his closely UNK-401 head . he felt it UNK-828 and 
 seeing himself as he lay UNK-24 . soon he would sleep . 
 UNK-0 
 he had written UNK-351 for her again after ten years . ten years before 
 she had worn her UNK-975 UNK-320 about her head sending UNK-578 of her 
 warm breath into the night air UNK-451 her foot upon the UNK-86 road . 
 it was the last UNK-80 the UNK-987 brown horses knew it and UNK-35 their 
 UNK-215 to the clear night in UNK-291 . the UNK-654 talked with the 
 driver both UNK-278 often in the green light of the lamp . they stood 
 on the steps of the UNK-80 he on the upper she on the lower . she came 
 up to his step many times between their phrases and went down again and 
 once or twice remained beside him UNK-779 to go down and then went 
 down . let be ! let be ! 
 UNK-0 
 ten years from that wisdom of children to his UNK-813 . if he sent her the 
 UNK-351 ? they would be read out at breakfast UNK-22 the UNK-451 of 
 UNK-450 . UNK-813 indeed ! her brothers would laugh and try to UNK-613 the 
 page from each other with their strong hard fingers . the UNK-144 priest 
 her uncle UNK-154 in his UNK-731 would hold the page at arms 
 length read it UNK-21 and approve of the literary form . 
 UNK-0 
 no no that was UNK-813 . even if he sent her the UNK-351 she would not 
 show them to others . no no she could not . 
 UNK-0 
 he began to feel that he had UNK-258 her . a sense of her UNK-636 
 moved him almost to UNK-47 her an UNK-636 he had never understood till 
 he had come to the knowledge of it through sin an UNK-636 which she 
 too had not understood while she was innocent or before the strange 
 UNK-396 of her nature had first come upon her . then first her soul 
 had begun to live as his soul had when he had first UNK-251 and a 
 tender UNK-653 filled his heart as he remembered her UNK-422 UNK-917 
 and her eyes UNK-558 and UNK-579 by the dark shame of UNK-122 . 
 UNK-0 
 while his soul had passed from UNK-119 to UNK-389 where had she been ? 
 might it be in the mysterious ways of spiritual life that her soul at 
 those same moments had been conscious of his UNK-77 ? it might be . 
 UNK-0 
 a glow of desire UNK-537 again his soul and fired and UNK-152 all his 
 body . conscious of his desire she was UNK-632 from UNK-4 sleep the 
 UNK-666 of his UNK-351 . her eyes dark and with a look of UNK-389 
 were opening to his eyes . her UNK-324 UNK-941 to him UNK-543 warm 
 UNK-4 and UNK-442 UNK-598 him like a UNK-160 cloud UNK-598 
 him like water with a liquid life and like a cloud of UNK-575 or like 
 waters UNK-425 in space the liquid letters of speech symbols of 
 the element of mystery UNK-760 forth over his brain . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  are you not UNK-129 of UNK-452 ways 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-38 of the fallen UNK-222 ?

 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  your eyes have set UNK-54 heart UNK-703 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  and you have had your will of him .

 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  above the flame the smoke of praise 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  goes up from ocean rim to rim . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  tell no more of UNK-610 days . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  our broken UNK-155 and UNK-938 UNK-908

 UNK-0  UNK-0  are you not UNK-129 of UNK-452 ways ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  while UNK-969 hands UNK-869 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  the UNK-677 UNK-441 to the UNK-233 . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  tell no more of UNK-610 days . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  and still you hold our UNK-868 UNK-49 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  with UNK-359 look and UNK-720 UNK-987 !

 UNK-0 
 what birds were they ? he stood on the steps of the library to look at 
 them UNK-200 UNK-853 on his UNK-194 . they UNK-230 round and round the 
 UNK-805 shoulder of a house in UNK-946 street . the air of the late 
 march evening made clear their flight their dark UNK-106 bodies 
 flying clearly against the sky as against a UNK-734 cloth of UNK-62 
 UNK-347 blue . 
 UNK-0 
 he watched their flight bird after bird a dark flash a UNK-704 a 
 UNK-782 of wings . he tried to count them before all their UNK-135 
 UNK-106 bodies passed six ten eleven and UNK-105 were they odd 
 or even in number . twelve UNK-79 for two came UNK-149 down from the 
 upper sky . they were flying high and low but ever round and round in 
 straight and UNK-746 lines and ever flying from left to right UNK-748 
 about a temple of air . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-126 to the UNK-155 like the UNK-392 of mice behind the UNK-473 
 a UNK-367 UNK-479 note . but the notes were long and UNK-367 and UNK-433 
 unlike the cry of UNK-579 falling a third or a fourth and UNK-137 as 
 the flying UNK-721 UNK-882 the air . their cry was UNK-367 and clear and fine 
 and falling like threads of UNK-376 light UNK-976 from UNK-433 UNK-929 . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-504 UNK-216 UNK-485 his ears in which his mothers UNK-319 and 
 UNK-653 UNK-203 UNK-236 and the dark UNK-422 UNK-106 bodies 
 UNK-149 and UNK-923 and UNK-842 round an UNK-184 temple of the 
 UNK-347 sky UNK-485 his eyes which still saw the image of his mothers 
 face . 
 UNK-0 
 why was he UNK-248 UNK-356 from the steps of the UNK-372 hearing their 
 UNK-367 UNK-479 cry watching their flight ? for an UNK-504 of good or 
 evil ? a phrase of UNK-724 UNK-795 UNK-230 through his mind and then 
 there UNK-230 UNK-763 and UNK-467 UNK-377 thoughts from UNK-991 on the 
 correspondence of birds to things of the UNK-678 and of how the 
 creatures of the air have their knowledge and know their times and 
 seasons because they unlike man are in the order of their life and 
 have not UNK-353 that order by reason . 
 UNK-0 
 and for ages men had UNK-84 UNK-266 as he was UNK-248 at birds in flight . 
 the UNK-795 above him made him think UNK-489 of an ancient temple and 
 the UNK-194 on which he UNK-122 UNK-853 of the UNK-773 stick of an 
 UNK-35 . a sense of fear of the unknown moved in the heart of his 
 UNK-890 a fear of symbols and UNK-114 of the UNK-712 man whose 
 name he UNK-135 UNK-509 out of his UNK-772 on UNK-88 wings of 
 UNK-788 the god of writers writing with a reed upon a tablet and 
 bearing on his narrow UNK-514 head the UNK-830 moon . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-24 as he thought of the gods image for it made him think of a 
 UNK-235 judge in a UNK-726 putting UNK-545 into a document which he 
 held at arms length and he knew that he would not have remembered the 
 gods name but that it was like an irish UNK-19 . it was UNK-813 . but was it 
 for this UNK-813 that he was about to leave for ever the house of prayer 
 and UNK-861 into which he had been born and the order of life out of 
 which he had come ? 
 UNK-0 
 they came back with UNK-367 UNK-155 over the UNK-805 shoulder of the 
 house flying UNK-326 against the UNK-546 air . what birds were they ? he 
 thought that they must be UNK-928 who had come back from the south . 
 then he was to go away for they were birds ever going and coming 
 building ever an UNK-23 home under the UNK-927 of mens houses and 
 ever leaving the homes they had built to UNK-588 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  bend down your faces UNK-303 and UNK-238 . 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  i UNK-49 upon them as the UNK-741 UNK-191 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  upon the nest under the UNK-636 before 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  he UNK-588 the loud waters . 
 UNK-0 
 a soft liquid joy like the noise of many waters UNK-760 over his memory 
 and he felt in his heart the soft peace of silent spaces of UNK-546 
 UNK-347 sky above the waters of UNK-139 silence of UNK-928 flying 
 through the UNK-571 over the UNK-441 waters . 
 UNK-0 
 a soft liquid joy UNK-760 through the words where the soft long UNK-842 
 UNK-759 UNK-963 and fell away UNK-252 and UNK-441 back and ever 
 UNK-144 the white UNK-215 of their waves in UNK-483 UNK-44 and UNK-483 UNK-909 and 
 soft low UNK-158 cry and he felt that the UNK-504 he had sought in the 
 UNK-149 UNK-135 birds and in the pale space of sky above him had come 
 forth from his heart like a bird from a UNK-979 UNK-40 and UNK-171 . 
 UNK-0 
 symbol of departure or of UNK-964 ? the UNK-351 UNK-258 in the ear of 
 his memory composed slowly before his UNK-617 eyes the scene of the 
 hall on the night of the opening of the national theatre . he was alone 
 at the side of the UNK-994 looking out of UNK-901 eyes at the culture of 
 dublin in the UNK-778 and at the UNK-627 UNK-682 and human dolls 
 framed by the UNK-207 lamps of the stage . a UNK-548 UNK-869 UNK-488 behind 
 him and seemed at every moment about to act . the UNK-24 and UNK-611 and 
 UNK-55 UNK-155 ran in UNK-292 UNK-816 round the hall from his UNK-824 fellow 
 students . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-763 on ireland ! 
 UNK-0 
 made in germany . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-566 ! 
 UNK-0 
 we never sold our faith ! 
 UNK-0 
 no irish woman ever did it ! 
 UNK-0 
 we want no amateur UNK-867 . 
 UNK-0 
 we want no UNK-346 UNK-912 . 
 UNK-0 
 a sudden swift UNK-72 fell from the windows above him and he knew that 
 the electric lamps had been switched on in the readers room . he turned 
 into the UNK-275 hall now UNK-331 lit went up the UNK-116 and 
 passed in through the clicking UNK-46 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 was sitting over near the dictionaries . a thick book opened at 
 the UNK-743 lay before him on the wooden rest . he UNK-122 back in 
 his chair UNK-580 his ear like that of a UNK-708 to the face of 
 the medical student who was reading to him a problem from the chess 
 page of a journal . stephen sat down at his right and the priest at the 
 other side of the table closed his copy of the tablet with an angry 
 snap and stood up . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 UNK-84 after him UNK-982 and UNK-489 . the medical student went on 
 in a UNK-43 voice 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-858 to kings fourth . 
 UNK-0 
 we had better go UNK-110 said stephen in warning . he has gone to 
 UNK-661 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-110 UNK-177 the journal and rose with UNK-491 saying 
 UNK-0 
 our men retired in good order . 
 UNK-0 
 with guns and cattle added stephen pointing to the UNK-472 of 
 UNK-368 book on which was printed diseases of the UNK-921 . 
 UNK-0 
 as they passed through a lane of the tables stephen said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 i want to speak to you . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 did not answer or turn . he laid his book on the counter and 
 passed out his UNK-445 feet UNK-253 UNK-692 on the floor . on the 
 UNK-116 he UNK-214 and UNK-248 UNK-124 at UNK-110 repeated 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-858 to kings bloody fourth . 
 UNK-0 
 put it that way if you like UNK-110 said . 
 UNK-0 
 he had a quiet UNK-336 voice and UNK-942 UNK-347 and on a finger of his 
 UNK-191 clean hand he displayed at moments a UNK-218 ring . 
 UNK-0 
 as they UNK-112 the hall a man of UNK-601 UNK-837 came towards them . 
 under the dome of his tiny hat his UNK-180 face began to smile with 
 pleasure and he was heard to UNK-208 . the eyes were UNK-724 as those 
 of a monkey . 
 UNK-0 
 good evening UNK-32 said the UNK-867 UNK-29 face . 
 UNK-0 
 warm weather for march said UNK-12 . they have the windows open 
 UNK-316 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-110 UNK-24 and turned his ring . the UNK-612 UNK-334 face 
 UNK-154 its human mouth with gentle pleasure and its voice UNK-928 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-80 weather for march . simply UNK-80 . 
 UNK-0 
 there are two nice young ladies UNK-316 captain tired of waiting 
 UNK-110 said . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 UNK-24 and said UNK-320 
 UNK-0 
 the captain has only one love sir walter scott . UNK-50 that so 
 captain ? 
 UNK-0 
 what are you reading now captain ? UNK-110 asked . the bride of 
 UNK-255 ? 
 UNK-0 
 i love old scott the flexible lips said i think he writes something 
 lovely . there is no writer can touch sir walter scott . 
 UNK-0 
 he moved a thin UNK-409 brown hand gently in the air in time to his 
 praise and his thin quick UNK-863 beat often over his sad eyes . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-319 to UNK-8 ear was his speech a UNK-805 accent low and 
 UNK-295 UNK-588 by errors and listening to it he UNK-105 was the 
 story true and was the thin blood that UNK-760 in his UNK-409 frame 
 noble and come of an UNK-35 love ? 
 UNK-0 
 the park trees were heavy with rain and rain fell still and ever in 
 the lake lying grey like a shield . a game of UNK-537 UNK-230 there and the 
 water and the shore beneath were UNK-515 with their UNK-916 UNK-124 . 
 they UNK-448 UNK-41 UNK-439 by the grey UNK-726 light the wet 
 silent trees the UNK-129 UNK-704 lake the UNK-537 . they UNK-448 
 without joy or passion his arm about his sisters neck . a grey UNK-846 
 UNK-382 was wrapped UNK-825 her from her shoulder to her UNK-599 and her 
 fair head was bent in willing shame . he had loose UNK-525 hair and 
 tender UNK-116 strong UNK-977 hands . face ? there was no face seen . the 
 brothers face was bent upon her fair UNK-939 hair . the hand 
 UNK-977 and strong and UNK-116 and UNK-539 was UNK-962 hand . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-654 UNK-551 upon his thought and on the UNK-421 UNK-727 who 
 had called it forth . his fathers UNK-647 at the UNK-849 gang UNK-714 out 
 of his memory . he held them at a distance and UNK-444 UNK-523 on his 
 own thought again . why were they not UNK-368 hands ? had UNK-962 
 UNK-719 and UNK-636 UNK-257 him more UNK-935 ? 
 UNK-0 
 he walked on across the hall with UNK-110 leaving UNK-12 to take leave 
 UNK-844 of the UNK-963 . 
 UNK-0 
 under the UNK-795 temple was standing in the UNK-619 of a little group 
 of students . one of them UNK-5 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-110 come over till you hear . temple is in grand form . 
 UNK-0 
 temple turned on him his dark UNK-231 eyes . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-14 a UNK-437 UNK-739 he said . and UNK-110 is a UNK-381 . by 
 hell i think thats a good literary expression . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-20 UNK-899 looking in UNK-8 face UNK-598 
 UNK-0 
 by hell im UNK-649 with that name . a UNK-381 . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-98 student who stood below them on the steps said 
 UNK-0 
 come back to the mistress temple . we want to hear about that . 
 UNK-0 
 he had faith temple said . and he was a married man too . and all the 
 UNK-73 used to be dining there . by hell i think they all had a touch . 
 UNK-0 
 we shall call it riding a hack to spare the hunter said UNK-110 . 
 UNK-0 
 tell us temple UNK-739 said how many UNK-679 of porter have you 
 in you ? 
 UNK-0 
 all your intellectual soul is in that phrase UNK-739 said temple 
 with open UNK-589 . 
 UNK-0 
 he moved with a UNK-519 UNK-965 round the group and spoke to stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 did you know that the UNK-578 are the kings of belgium ? he asked . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 came out through the door of the entrance hall his hat UNK-243 
 back on the UNK-157 of his neck and picking his teeth with care . 
 UNK-0 
 and UNK-182 the UNK-269 said temple . do you know that about the 
 UNK-578 ? 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-214 for an answer . UNK-12 UNK-423 a UNK-232 from his teeth on 
 the point of his UNK-292 UNK-999 and UNK-84 at it UNK-978 . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-392 family temple said is UNK-244 from UNK-610 the 
 first king of UNK-277 . he was called the UNK-381 . UNK-381 and 
 UNK-392 are the same name . a UNK-659 of UNK-610 the first captain 
 francis UNK-392 settled in ireland and married the daughter of the 
 last UNK-374 of UNK-839 . then there are the blake UNK-578 . 
 thats a different branch . 
 UNK-0 
 from UNK-838 king of UNK-277 UNK-12 repeated UNK-108 again 
 UNK-177 at his UNK-494 UNK-300 teeth . 
 UNK-0 
 where did you pick up all that history ? UNK-739 asked . 
 UNK-0 
 i know all the history of your family too temple said turning to 
 stephen . do you know what UNK-321 UNK-704 says about your family ? 
 UNK-0 
 is he UNK-244 from UNK-610 too ? asked a tall UNK-904 student 
 with dark eyes . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-838 UNK-12 repeated sucking at a UNK-293 in his teeth . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-823 et UNK-978 UNK-437 temple said to stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-98 student who stood below them on the steps UNK-735 briefly . UNK-110 
 turned towards him saying in a soft voice 
 UNK-0 
 did an angel speak ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 turned also and said UNK-336 but without anger 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-235 UNK-14 the UNK-172 dirty devil i ever met do you know . 
 UNK-0 
 i had it on my mind to say that UNK-235 answered UNK-419 . it did no 
 one any harm did it ? 
 UNK-0 
 we hope UNK-110 said UNK-338 that it was not of the kind known to 
 science as a UNK-370 post UNK-44 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-3 i tell you he was a UNK-381 ? said temple turning right and 
 left . UNK-3 i give him that name ? 
 UNK-0 
 you did . were not deaf said the tall UNK-904 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 still UNK-654 at the UNK-98 student below him . then with a UNK-713 
 of UNK-731 he UNK-753 him UNK-611 down the steps . 
 UNK-0 
 go away from here he said UNK-394 . go away you UNK-174 . and you are a 
 UNK-174 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-235 UNK-92 down on to the UNK-59 and at once returned to his place 
 with good UNK-179 . temple turned back to stephen and asked 
 UNK-0 
 do you believe in the law of UNK-0 ? 
 UNK-0 
 are you drunk or what are you or what are you trying to say ? asked 
 UNK-12 facing round on him with an expression of wonder . 
 UNK-0 
 the most UNK-240 sentence ever written temple said with 
 UNK-311 is the sentence at the end of the UNK-296 . reproduction is 
 the beginning of death . 
 UNK-0 
 he touched stephen UNK-686 at the UNK-213 and said UNK-433 
 UNK-0 
 do you feel how UNK-240 that is because you are a poet ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 pointed his long UNK-487 . 
 UNK-0 
 look at him ! he said with UNK-589 to the others . look at UNK-192 hope ! 
 UNK-0 
 they UNK-20 at his words and UNK-359 . temple turned on him UNK-33 
 saying 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 UNK-14 always UNK-720 at me . i can see that . but i am as 
 good as you any day . do you know what i think about you now as compared 
 with myself ? 
 UNK-0 
 my dear man said UNK-12 UNK-755 you are UNK-126 do you know 
 absolutely UNK-126 of thinking . 
 UNK-0 
 but do you know temple went on what i think of you and of myself 
 compared together ? 
 UNK-0 
 out with it temple ! the UNK-98 student UNK-5 from the steps . get it 
 out in bits ! 
 UNK-0 
 temple turned right and left making sudden UNK-879 UNK-746 as he spoke . 
 UNK-0 
 im a UNK-983 he said UNK-144 his head in UNK-85 . i am and i 
 know i am . and i admit it that i am . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-110 UNK-788 him UNK-79 on the shoulder and said UNK-124 
 UNK-0 
 and it does you every credit temple . 
 UNK-0 
 but he temple said pointing to UNK-12 he is a UNK-983 too like 
 me . only he UNK-55 know it . and thats the only difference i see . 
 UNK-0 
 a burst of UNK-31 covered his words . but he turned again to stephen 
 and said with a sudden UNK-700 
 UNK-0 
 that word is a most interesting word . thats the only english dual 
 number . did you know ? 
 UNK-0 
 is it ? stephen said UNK-489 . 
 UNK-0 
 he was watching UNK-368 UNK-939 suffering face lit up now by a 
 smile of false UNK-435 . the gross name had passed over it like foul 
 water UNK-207 over an old stone image patient of injuries and as he 
 watched him he saw him raise his hat in UNK-465 and UNK-491 the black 
 hair that stood UNK-255 from his UNK-133 like an iron crown . 
 UNK-0 
 she passed out from the UNK-372 of the library and UNK-170 across stephen 
 in reply to UNK-368 greeting . he also ? was there not a slight flush on 
 UNK-368 UNK-139 ? or had it come forth at UNK-97 words ? the light had 
 UNK-459 . he could not see . 
 UNK-0 
 did that explain his friends UNK-826 silence his UNK-142 comments the 
 sudden UNK-882 of UNK-292 speech with which he had UNK-155 so often 
 UNK-8 UNK-452 UNK-752 UNK-67 ? stephen had UNK-963 freely for 
 he had found this UNK-923 also in himself . and he remembered an 
 evening when he had UNK-616 from a UNK-935 UNK-666 bicycle to pray 
 to god in a wood near UNK-684 . he had UNK-64 up his arms and spoken in 
 UNK-119 to the UNK-967 UNK-271 of the trees knowing that he stood on holy 
 ground and in a holy hour . and when two UNK-397 men had come into 
 sight round a bend in the UNK-484 road he had broken off his prayer to 
 UNK-266 UNK-76 an air from the last UNK-715 . 
 UNK-0 
 he began to beat the UNK-221 end of his UNK-194 against the base of a 
 UNK-271 . had UNK-12 not heard him ? yet he could wait . the talk about him 
 UNK-167 for a moment and a soft UNK-72 fell again from a window above . but 
 no other sound was in the air and the UNK-928 whose flight he had 
 followed with idle eyes were sleeping . 
 UNK-0 
 she had passed through the UNK-322 . and therefore the air was silent save 
 for one soft UNK-72 that fell . and therefore the UNK-591 about him had 
 UNK-167 their UNK-530 . darkness was falling . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  darkness falls from the air . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-178 joy UNK-702 as a UNK-90 light played like a fairy host 
 around him . but why ? her passage through the UNK-3 air or the verse 
 with its black UNK-842 and its opening sound rich and UNK-186 ? 
 UNK-0 
 he walked away slowly towards the deeper shadows at the end of the 
 UNK-795 UNK-570 the stone UNK-41 with his stick to hide his UNK-562 
 from the students whom he had left and allowed his mind to UNK-597 back 
 to itself the age of UNK-625 and UNK-504 and UNK-803 . 
 UNK-0 
 eyes opening from the darkness of desire eyes that UNK-718 the 
 breaking east . what was their UNK-736 grace but the UNK-674 of 
 UNK-399 ? and what was their UNK-783 but the UNK-783 of the UNK-974 that 
 UNK-536 the UNK-434 of the court of a UNK-139 stuart . and he UNK-561 
 in the language of memory UNK-979 wines dying UNK-180 of sweet UNK-883 
 the proud UNK-189 and saw with the eyes of memory kind UNK-743 in 
 UNK-168 garden UNK-62 from their UNK-32 with sucking UNK-682 and the 
 UNK-289 UNK-982 of the UNK-424 and young wives that UNK-219 UNK-76 
 to their UNK-78 UNK-852 and UNK-852 again . 
 UNK-0 
 the images he had UNK-960 gave him no pleasure . they were secret and 
 UNK-709 but her image was not UNK-799 by them . that was not the way 
 to think of her . it was not even the way in which he thought of her . 
 could his mind then not trust itself ? old phrases sweet only with a 
 UNK-344 UNK-551 like the UNK-179 UNK-12 UNK-868 out of his 
 UNK-494 teeth . 
 UNK-0 
 it was not thought nor vision though he knew UNK-489 that her figure 
 was passing UNK-94 through the city . UNK-489 first and then more 
 UNK-278 he UNK-616 her body . a conscious UNK-927 UNK-772 in his blood . 
 yes it was her body he UNK-616 a wild and UNK-736 smell the UNK-724 
 UNK-477 over which his music had UNK-760 UNK-774 and the secret soft 
 UNK-683 upon which her flesh UNK-764 UNK-143 and a UNK-826 . 
 UNK-0 
 a UNK-415 UNK-344 over the UNK-157 of his neck and putting his thumb and 
 UNK-487 UNK-765 beneath his loose collar he caught it . he rolled its 
 body tender yet UNK-14 as a grain of rice between thumb and finger 
 for an instant before he let it fall from him and UNK-105 would it 
 live or die . there came to his mind a curious phrase from UNK-724 a 
 UNK-196 which said that the UNK-454 born of human UNK-893 were not created by 
 god with the other animals on the sixth day . but the UNK-96 of the 
 skin of his neck made his mind raw and red . the life of his body ill 
 UNK-379 ill fed UNK-332 made him close his UNK-863 in a sudden 
 UNK-854 of UNK-85 and in the darkness he saw the UNK-14 bright bodies 
 of UNK-454 falling from the air and turning often as they fell . yes and 
 it was not darkness that fell from the air . it was UNK-831 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-831 falls from the air . 
 UNK-0 
 he had not even remembered UNK-793 UNK-267 line . all the images it had 
 UNK-329 were false . his mind UNK-338 UNK-579 . his thoughts were UNK-454 born 
 of the UNK-893 of UNK-830 . 
 UNK-0 
 he came back quickly along the UNK-795 towards the group of students . 
 well then let her go and be UNK-100 to her ! she could love some clean 
 UNK-495 who UNK-466 himself every morning to the UNK-599 and had black 
 hair on his chest . let her . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 had taken another dried fig from the supply in his pocket and 
 was eating it slowly and UNK-267 . temple sat on the UNK-537 of a 
 UNK-271 UNK-200 back his cap pulled down on his UNK-638 eyes . a UNK-737 
 young man came out of the UNK-372 a leather portfolio UNK-852 under his 
 UNK-144 . he UNK-982 towards the group striking the flags with the UNK-183 
 of his boots and with the UNK-145 of his heavy UNK-148 . then raising 
 the UNK-148 in UNK-465 he said to all 
 UNK-0 
 good evening UNK-79 . 
 UNK-0 
 he struck the flags again and UNK-734 while his head UNK-515 with a 
 slight nervous movement . the tall UNK-904 student and UNK-110 and 
 UNK-739 were speaking in irish and did not answer him . then turning 
 to UNK-12 he said 
 UNK-0 
 good evening particularly to you . 
 UNK-0 
 he moved the UNK-148 in indication and UNK-734 again . UNK-12 who was 
 still UNK-574 the fig answered with loud movements of his UNK-968 . 
 UNK-0 
 good ? yes . it is a good evening . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-737 student looked at him seriously and UNK-35 his UNK-148 gently 
 and UNK-392 . 
 UNK-0 
 i can see he said that you are about to make obvious remarks . 
 UNK-0 
 um UNK-12 answered holding out what remained of the half UNK-24 
 fig and UNK-836 it towards the UNK-737 students mouth in sign that he 
 should eat . 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-737 student did not eat it but UNK-599 his special UNK-179 
 said UNK-141 still UNK-472 and UNK-133 his phrase with his 
 UNK-148 
 UNK-0 
 do you intend that . . . ? 
 UNK-0 
 he broke off pointed UNK-770 to the UNK-279 UNK-399 of the fig and said 
 UNK-76 
 UNK-0 
 i UNK-782 to that . 
 UNK-0 
 um UNK-12 said as before . 
 UNK-0 
 do you intend that now the UNK-737 student said as UNK-155 UNK-102 or 
 let us say as so to speak ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-110 turned aside from his group saying 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-235 was waiting for you UNK-687 . he has gone round to the UNK-833 
 to look for you and UNK-916 . what have you there ? he asked UNK-451 
 the portfolio under UNK-249 arm . 
 UNK-0 
 examination papers UNK-687 answered . i give them monthly examinations 
 to see that they are UNK-796 by my tuition . 
 UNK-0 
 he also UNK-408 the portfolio and UNK-137 gently and UNK-24 . 
 UNK-0 
 tuition ! said UNK-12 UNK-394 . i suppose you mean the UNK-606 
 children that are taught by a bloody UNK-292 like you . god help them ! 
 UNK-0 
 he bit off the rest of the fig and UNK-168 away the butt . 
 UNK-0 
 i suffer little children to come unto me UNK-687 said UNK-760 . 
 UNK-0 
 a bloody UNK-292 UNK-12 repeated with emphasis and a UNK-208 
 bloody UNK-292 ! 
 UNK-0 
 temple stood up and pushing past UNK-12 addressed UNK-687 
 UNK-0 
 that phrase you said now he said is from the new testament about 
 suffer the children to come to me . 
 UNK-0 
 go to sleep again temple said UNK-739 . 
 UNK-0 
 very well then temple continued still addressing UNK-687 and if 
 jesus suffered the children to come why does the church send them all 
 to hell if they die UNK-209 ? why is that ? 
 UNK-0 
 were you UNK-558 yourself temple ? the UNK-904 student asked . 
 UNK-0 
 but why are they sent to hell if jesus said they were all to come ? 
 temple said his eyes searching UNK-249 eyes . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-687 UNK-137 and said gently holding back with difficulty the nervous 
 UNK-289 in his voice and moving his UNK-148 at every word 
 UNK-0 
 and as you remark if it is thus i ask UNK-695 UNK-422 comes 
 this UNK-241 . 
 UNK-0 
 because the church is UNK-165 like all old UNK-608 temple said . 
 UNK-0 
 are you quite UNK-40 on that point temple ? UNK-110 said UNK-338 . 
 UNK-0 
 saint UNK-993 says that about UNK-209 children going to hell 
 temple answered because he was a UNK-165 old UNK-473 too . 
 UNK-0 
 i bow to you UNK-110 said but i had the impression that UNK-487 
 existed for such cases . 
 UNK-0 
 dont argue with him UNK-110 UNK-12 said UNK-685 . dont talk to him 
 or look at him . lead him home with a UNK-97 the way UNK-306 lead a 
 UNK-159 goat . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-487 ! temple UNK-5 . thats a fine invention too . like hell . 
 UNK-0 
 but with the UNK-71 left out UNK-110 said . 
 UNK-0 
 he turned UNK-21 to the others and said 
 UNK-0 
 i think i am UNK-308 the opinions of all present in saying so much . 
 UNK-0 
 you are UNK-687 said in a firm tone . on that point ireland is united . 
 UNK-0 
 he struck the UNK-145 of his UNK-148 on the stone floor of the 
 UNK-795 . 
 UNK-0 
 hell temple said . i can respect that invention of the grey spouse 
 of UNK-445 . hell is roman like the walls of the UNK-490 strong and ugly . 
 but what is UNK-487 ? 
 UNK-0 
 put him back into the UNK-827 UNK-12 UNK-739 called out . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 made a swift step towards temple UNK-46 UNK-349 his foot 
 UNK-273 as if to a UNK-918 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-939 ! 
 UNK-0 
 temple moved away UNK-901 . 
 UNK-0 
 do you know what UNK-487 is ? he UNK-5 . do you know what we call a 
 notion like that in UNK-451 ? 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-939 ! blast you ! UNK-12 UNK-5 UNK-374 his hands . 
 UNK-0 
 neither my UNK-865 nor my UNK-213 ! temple UNK-5 out UNK-784 . and 
 thats what i call UNK-487 . 
 UNK-0 
 give us that stick here UNK-12 said . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-112 the UNK-194 roughly from UNK-8 hand and UNK-418 down 
 the steps but temple hearing him move in pursuit UNK-706 through the 
 UNK-322 like a wild creature UNK-59 and UNK-509 . UNK-368 heavy 
 boots were heard UNK-76 charging across the UNK-955 and then 
 returning heavily UNK-826 and UNK-921 the UNK-59 at each step . 
 UNK-0 
 his step was angry and with an angry UNK-52 UNK-359 he UNK-243 the stick 
 back into UNK-8 hand . stephen felt that his anger had another cause 
 but UNK-945 UNK-435 touched his arm slightly and said UNK-40 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 i told you i wanted to speak to you . come away . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 looked at him for a few moments and asked 
 UNK-0 
 now ? 
 UNK-0 
 yes now stephen said . we cant speak here . come away . 
 UNK-0 
 they UNK-112 the UNK-955 together without speaking . the bird call 
 from UNK-86 UNK-250 UNK-41 followed them from the steps of the 
 UNK-372 . UNK-12 turned and UNK-110 who had UNK-250 called out 
 UNK-0 
 where are you UNK-13 off to ? what about that game UNK-12 ? 
 UNK-0 
 they UNK-927 in UNK-508 across the still air about a game of UNK-412 
 to be played in the UNK-833 hotel . stephen walked on alone and out into 
 the quiet of UNK-328 street opposite UNK-607 hotel he stood to wait 
 patient again . the name of the hotel a UNK-850 polished wood and 
 its UNK-850 front UNK-257 him like a glance of UNK-727 UNK-280 . he 
 UNK-156 UNK-551 back at the UNK-41 lit UNK-411 of the hotel in 
 which he UNK-747 the UNK-553 lives of the UNK-366 of ireland UNK-398 
 in calm . they thought of army commissions and land agents UNK-926 
 UNK-593 them along the roads in the country they knew the names of 
 certain french dishes and gave orders to UNK-91 in UNK-691 
 provincial voices which UNK-650 through their UNK-961 UNK-122 . 
 UNK-0 
 how could he hit their UNK-212 or how cast his shadow over the 
 UNK-981 of their daughters before their UNK-432 UNK-192 upon them 
 that they might breed a race less UNK-534 than their own ? and under the 
 UNK-699 UNK-322 he felt the thoughts and UNK-46 of the race to which he 
 UNK-386 UNK-181 like UNK-430 across the dark country lanes under trees 
 by the edges of streams and near the UNK-587 UNK-513 . a woman had 
 UNK-56 in the UNK-102 as UNK-232 had passed by at night and offering him 
 a cup of milk had all but UNK-997 him to her bed for UNK-232 had the mild 
 eyes of one who could be secret . but him no UNK-95 eyes had UNK-997 . 
 UNK-0 
 his arm was taken in a strong grip and UNK-368 voice said 
 UNK-0 
 let us UNK-49 go . 
 UNK-0 
 they walked UNK-302 in silence . then UNK-12 said 
 UNK-0 
 that UNK-374 UNK-818 temple ! i UNK-425 to moses do you know that 
 ill be the death of that fellow one time . 
 UNK-0 
 but his voice was no longer angry and stephen UNK-105 was he thinking 
 of her greeting to him under the UNK-372 . 
 UNK-0 
 they turned to the left and walked on as before . when they had gone on 
 so for some time stephen said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 i had an UNK-144 UNK-924 this evening . 
 UNK-0 
 with your people ? UNK-12 asked . 
 UNK-0 
 with my mother . 
 UNK-0 
 about religion ? 
 UNK-0 
 yes stephen answered . 
 UNK-0 
 after a UNK-242 UNK-12 asked 
 UNK-0 
 what age is your mother ? 
 UNK-0 
 not old stephen said . she wishes me to make my easter duty . 
 UNK-0 
 and will you ? 
 UNK-0 
 i will not stephen said . 
 UNK-0 
 why not ? UNK-12 said . 
 UNK-0 
 i will not serve answered stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 that remark was made before UNK-12 said UNK-331 . 
 UNK-0 
 it is made behind now said stephen UNK-25 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 pressed UNK-8 arm saying 
 UNK-0 
 go easy my dear man . UNK-14 an UNK-510 bloody man do you know . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-20 UNK-409 as he spoke and looking up into UNK-8 face 
 with moved and friendly eyes said 
 UNK-0 
 do you know that you are an UNK-510 man ? 
 UNK-0 
 i UNK-48 i am said stephen laughing also . 
 UNK-0 
 their minds lately UNK-953 seemed suddenly to have been drawn 
 closer one to the other . 
 UNK-0 
 do you believe in the UNK-47 ? UNK-12 asked . 
 UNK-0 
 i do not stephen said . 
 UNK-0 
 do you UNK-64 then ? 
 UNK-0 
 i neither believe in it nor UNK-64 in it stephen answered . 
 UNK-0 
 many persons have UNK-507 even religious persons yet they overcome 
 them or put them aside UNK-12 said . are your UNK-507 on that point too 
 strong ? 
 UNK-0 
 i do not wish to overcome them stephen answered . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 UNK-174 for a moment took another fig from his pocket and 
 was about to eat it when stephen said 
 UNK-0 
 dont please . you UNK-216 discuss this question with your mouth full 
 of UNK-24 fig . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 examined the fig by the light of a lamp under which he UNK-46 . 
 then he UNK-616 it with both UNK-304 bit a tiny piece UNK-339 it out and 
 UNK-163 the fig UNK-394 into the UNK-701 . 
 UNK-0 
 addressing it as it lay he said 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-991 from me ye UNK-657 into UNK-417 fire ! 
 UNK-0 
 taking UNK-8 arm he went on again and said 
 UNK-0 
 do you not fear that those words may be spoken to you on the day of 
 UNK-623 ? 
 UNK-0 
 what is offered me on the other hand ? stephen asked . an UNK-162 of 
 UNK-120 in the company of the dean of studies ? 
 UNK-0 
 remember UNK-12 said that he would be UNK-652 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-42 stephen said somewhat UNK-828 bright UNK-386 UNK-615 and 
 above all subtle . 
 UNK-0 
 it is a curious thing do you know UNK-12 said UNK-56 how 
 your mind is UNK-271 with the religion in which you say you 
 UNK-64 . did you believe in it when you were at school ? i bet you 
 did . 
 UNK-0 
 i did stephen answered . 
 UNK-0 
 and were you UNK-101 then ? UNK-12 asked UNK-41 UNK-101 than you are 
 now for instance ? 
 UNK-0 
 often happy stephen said and often UNK-188 . i was someone else 
 then . 
 UNK-0 
 how someone else ? what do you mean by that statement ? 
 UNK-0 
 i mean said stephen that i was not myself as i am now as i had to 
 become . 
 UNK-0 
 not as you are now not as you had to become UNK-12 repeated . let 
 me ask you a question . do you love your mother ? 
 UNK-0 
 stephen UNK-35 his head slowly . 
 UNK-0 
 i dont know what your words mean he said simply . 
 UNK-0 
 have you never loved anyone ? UNK-12 asked . 
 UNK-0 
 do you mean women ? 
 UNK-0 
 i am not speaking of that UNK-12 said in a UNK-822 tone . i ask you 
 if you ever felt love towards anyone or anything ? 
 UNK-0 
 stephen walked on beside his friend UNK-151 UNK-153 at the UNK-125 . 
 UNK-0 
 i tried to love god he said at length . it seems now i failed . it is 
 very difficult . i tried to UNK-252 my will with the will of god instant 
 by instant . in that i did not always fail . i could perhaps do that 
 still 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 cut him short by asking 
 UNK-0 
 has your mother had a happy life ? 
 UNK-0 
 how do i know ? stephen said . 
 UNK-0 
 how many children had she ? 
 UNK-0 
 nine or ten stephen answered . some died . 
 UNK-0 
 was your father . . . UNK-12 UNK-9 himself for an instant and then 
 said i dont want to UNK-31 into your family affairs . but was your father 
 what is called UNK-417 ? i mean when you were growing up ? 
 UNK-0 
 yes stephen said . 
 UNK-0 
 what was he ? UNK-12 asked after a UNK-242 . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen began to UNK-160 UNK-169 his fathers attributes . 
 UNK-0 
 a medical student an UNK-468 a UNK-228 an amateur actor a UNK-929 
 UNK-645 a small UNK-417 a small investor a UNK-917 a good 
 fellow a UNK-355 UNK-680 secretary something in a 
 UNK-86 a UNK-9 a UNK-590 and at present a UNK-934 of his 
 own past . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 UNK-20 UNK-931 his grip on UNK-8 arm and said 
 UNK-0 
 the UNK-86 is damn good . 
 UNK-0 
 is there anything else you want to know ? stephen asked . 
 UNK-0 
 are you in good circumstances at present ? 
 UNK-0 
 do i look it ? stephen asked UNK-770 . 
 UNK-0 
 so then UNK-12 went on UNK-716 you were born in the lap of luxury . 
 UNK-0 
 he used the phrase UNK-839 and UNK-76 as he often used technical 
 expressions as if he UNK-136 his UNK-171 to understand that they were 
 used by him without conviction . 
 UNK-0 
 your mother must have gone through a good deal of suffering he said 
 then . would you not try to save her from suffering more even if . . . or would 
 you ? 
 UNK-0 
 if i could stephen said that would cost me very little . 
 UNK-0 
 then do so UNK-12 said . do as she wishes you to do . what is it for 
 you ? you UNK-64 in it . it is a form nothing else . and you will set 
 her mind at rest . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-167 and as stephen did not reply remained silent . then as if 
 giving UNK-652 to the process of his own thought he said 
 UNK-0 
 whatever else is UNK-11 in this UNK-372 UNK-167 of a world a 
 mothers love is not . your mother brings you into the world carries 
 you first in her body . what do we know about what she feels ? but 
 whatever she feels it at least must be real . it must be . what are 
 our ideas or UNK-654 ? play . ideas ! why that bloody UNK-159 goat 
 temple has ideas . UNK-595 has ideas too . every UNK-648 going the roads 
 thinks he has ideas . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen who had been listening to the UNK-555 speech behind the 
 words said with assumed UNK-14 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-421 if i remember UNK-793 would not suffer his mother to kiss 
 him as he UNK-60 the contact of her sex . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-421 was a pig said UNK-12 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-396 UNK-515 i think was of the same mind stephen said . 
 UNK-0 
 and he was another pig then said UNK-12 . 
 UNK-0 
 the church calls him a saint stephen UNK-357 . 
 UNK-0 
 i dont care a UNK-600 damn what anyone calls him UNK-12 said UNK-394 
 and UNK-692 . i call him a pig . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen preparing the words UNK-969 in his mind continued 
 UNK-0 
 jesus too seems to have treated his mother with UNK-231 courtesy in 
 public but UNK-576 a UNK-249 UNK-667 and spanish gentleman has 
 UNK-753 for him . 
 UNK-0 
 did the idea ever occur to you UNK-12 asked that jesus was not 
 what he UNK-204 to be ? 
 UNK-0 
 the first person to whom that idea occurred stephen answered was 
 jesus himself . 
 UNK-0 
 i mean UNK-12 said UNK-802 in his speech did the idea ever 
 occur to you that he was himself a conscious UNK-437 what he called 
 the jews of his time a UNK-62 UNK-226 ? or to put it more UNK-722 
 that he was a UNK-273 ? 
 UNK-0 
 that idea never occurred to me stephen answered . but i am curious 
 to know are you trying to make a convert of me or a UNK-517 of 
 yourself ? 
 UNK-0 
 he turned towards his friends face and saw there a raw smile which 
 some force of will UNK-952 to make UNK-163 significant . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 asked suddenly in a plain UNK-629 tone 
 UNK-0 
 tell me the truth . were you at all UNK-312 by what i said ? 
 UNK-0 
 somewhat stephen said . 
 UNK-0 
 and why were you UNK-312 UNK-12 pressed on in the same tone if you 
 feel sure that our religion is false and that jesus was not the son of 
 god ? 
 UNK-0 
 i am not at all sure of it stephen said . he is more like a son of 
 god than a son of mary . 
 UNK-0 
 and is that why you will not communicate UNK-12 asked because you 
 are not sure of that too because you feel that the host too may be 
 the body and blood of the son of god and not a UNK-785 of bread ? and 
 because you fear that it may be ? 
 UNK-0 
 yes stephen said UNK-40 i feel that and i also fear it . 
 UNK-0 
 i see UNK-12 said . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen struck by his tone of closure UNK-491 the discussion at once 
 by saying 
 UNK-0 
 i fear many things dogs horses UNK-790 the sea 
 UNK-158 machinery the country roads at night . 
 UNK-0 
 but why do you fear a bit of bread ? 
 UNK-0 
 i imagine stephen said that there is a UNK-732 reality behind 
 those things i say i fear . 
 UNK-0 
 do you fear then UNK-12 asked that the god of the roman UNK-535 
 would strike you dead and damn you if you made a UNK-369 
 UNK-415 ? 
 UNK-0 
 the god of the roman UNK-535 could do that now stephen said . i fear 
 more than that the chemical action which would be set up in my soul by 
 a false UNK-77 to a symbol behind which are UNK-413 twenty centuries of 
 authority and UNK-296 . 
 UNK-0 
 would you UNK-12 asked in extreme danger commit that particular 
 UNK-908 ? for instance if you lived in the UNK-546 days ? 
 UNK-0 
 i UNK-216 answer for the past stephen replied . possibly not . 
 UNK-0 
 then said UNK-12 you do not intend to become a UNK-560 ? 
 UNK-0 
 i said that i had lost the faith stephen answered but not that i 
 had lost UNK-817 . what kind of UNK-881 would that be to UNK-582 
 an UNK-706 which is logical and UNK-131 and to UNK-73 one which is 
 UNK-697 and UNK-917 ? 
 UNK-0 
 they had walked on towards the township of UNK-81 and now as they 
 went on slowly along the UNK-18 the trees and the UNK-824 lights in 
 the villas UNK-485 their minds . the air of wealth and UNK-835 UNK-717 
 about them seemed to comfort their UNK-755 . behind a UNK-722 of UNK-724 
 a light UNK-720 in the window of a kitchen and the voice of a UNK-363 
 was heard singing as she UNK-476 knives . she UNK-57 in short broken 
 bars 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-651 UNK-734 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 stopped to listen saying 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-673 UNK-864 . 
 UNK-0 
 the soft beauty of the latin word touched with an UNK-654 touch the 
 dark of the evening with a touch UNK-778 and more UNK-644 than the 
 touch of music or of a UNK-95 hand . the UNK-22 of their minds was 
 UNK-707 . the figure of a woman as she appears in the UNK-533 of the 
 church passed UNK-173 through the darkness a UNK-295 figure 
 small and UNK-293 as a boy and with a falling UNK-304 . her voice UNK-422 
 and high as a boys was heard UNK-781 from a distant choir the first 
 words of a woman which pierce the UNK-286 and UNK-216 of the first 
 UNK-955 of the passion 
 UNK-0 
 et tu cum UNK-668 UNK-304 UNK-816 . 
 UNK-0 
 and all hearts were touched and turned to her voice UNK-160 like a 
 young star UNK-160 UNK-598 as the voice UNK-119 the UNK-590 and 
 more UNK-284 as the UNK-435 died . 
 UNK-0 
 the singing UNK-167 . they went on together UNK-12 UNK-598 in strongly 
 UNK-277 rhythm the end of the UNK-499 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  and when we are married 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  o how happy well be 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  for i love sweet UNK-651 UNK-734 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  and UNK-651 UNK-734 loves me . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-6 real poetry for you he said . UNK-6 real love . 
 UNK-0 
 he UNK-75 UNK-174 at stephen with a strange smile and said 
 UNK-0 
 do you consider that poetry ? or do you know what the words mean ? 
 UNK-0 
 i want to see UNK-651 first said stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-23 easy to find UNK-12 said . 
 UNK-0 
 his hat had come down on his UNK-133 . he UNK-753 it back and in the 
 shadow of the trees stephen saw his pale face framed by the dark and 
 his large dark eyes . yes . his face was UNK-218 and his body was strong 
 and hard . he had spoken of a mothers love . he felt then the UNK-346 
 of women the UNK-947 of their bodies and souls and would shield 
 them with a strong and UNK-461 arm and bow his mind to them . 
 UNK-0 
 away then it is time to go . a voice spoke UNK-41 to UNK-8 lonely 
 heart bidding him go and telling him that his friendship was coming to 
 an end . yes he would go . he could not UNK-178 against another . he knew 
 his part . 
 UNK-0 
 probably i shall go away he said . 
 UNK-0 
 where ? UNK-12 asked . 
 UNK-0 
 where i can stephen said . 
 UNK-0 
 yes UNK-12 said . it might be difficult for you to live here now . 
 but is it that makes you go ? 
 UNK-0 
 i have to go stephen answered . 
 UNK-0 
 because UNK-12 continued you need not look upon yourself as driven 
 away if you do not wish to go or as a UNK-637 or an UNK-933 . there are 
 many good UNK-348 who think as you do . would that surprise you ? the 
 church is not the stone building nor even the UNK-906 and their UNK-175 . 
 it is the whole mass of those born into it . i dont know what you wish 
 to do in life . is it what you told me the night we were standing 
 outside UNK-164 street station ? 
 UNK-0 
 yes stephen said UNK-21 in UNK-300 of himself at UNK-368 way of 
 UNK-617 thoughts in UNK-0 with places . the night you spent half 
 an hour UNK-88 with UNK-480 about the UNK-795 way from UNK-533 to 
 UNK-900 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-452 ! UNK-12 said with calm UNK-251 . what does he know about the 
 way from UNK-533 to UNK-900 ? or what does he know about anything for 
 that matter ? and the big UNK-139 UNK-539 head of him ! 
 UNK-0 
 he broke into a loud long laugh . 
 UNK-0 
 well ? stephen said . do you remember the rest ? 
 UNK-0 
 what you said is it ? UNK-12 asked . yes i remember it . to discover the 
 mode of life or of art UNK-217 your spirit could express itself in 
 UNK-93 freedom . 
 UNK-0 
 stephen raised his hat in UNK-279 . 
 UNK-0 
 freedom ! UNK-12 repeated . but you are not free enough yet to commit 
 a UNK-908 . tell me would you rob ? 
 UNK-0 
 i would UNK-429 first stephen said . 
 UNK-0 
 and if you got nothing would you rob ? 
 UNK-0 
 you wish me to say stephen answered that the rights of property 
 are UNK-212 and that in certain circumstances it is not UNK-132 
 to rob . everyone would act in that belief . so i will not make you that 
 answer . apply to the UNK-249 UNK-667 juan UNK-468 de UNK-350 who 
 will also explain to you in what circumstances you may UNK-768 kill 
 your king and whether you had better hand him his poison in a UNK-68 or 
 UNK-213 it for him upon his UNK-905 or his UNK-627 . ask me rather would i 
 suffer others to rob me or if they did would i call down upon them 
 what i believe is called the UNK-310 of the UNK-238 arm ? 
 UNK-0 
 and would you ? 
 UNK-0 
 i think stephen said it would pain me as much to do so as to be 
 UNK-22 . 
 UNK-0 
 i see UNK-12 said . 
 UNK-0 
 he produced his match and began to clean the UNK-293 between two teeth . 
 then he said UNK-493 
 UNK-0 
 tell me for example would you UNK-301 a virgin ? 
 UNK-0 
 excuse me stephen said UNK-269 is that not the UNK-570 of most 
 young UNK-32 ? 
 UNK-0 
 what then is your point of view ? UNK-12 asked . 
 UNK-0 
 his last phrase UNK-878 UNK-749 as the smoke of UNK-360 and 
 UNK-187 excited UNK-8 brain over which its UNK-96 seemed to 
 UNK-771 . 
 UNK-0 
 look here UNK-12 he said . you have asked me what i would do and 
 what i would not do . i will tell you what i will do and what i will not 
 do . i will not serve that in which i no longer believe whether it call 
 itself my home my UNK-449 or my church and i will try to express 
 myself in some mode of life or art as freely as i can and as UNK-571 as 
 i can using for my defence the only arms i allow myself to UNK-8 
 UNK-386 and UNK-650 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 UNK-457 his arm and UNK-392 him round so as to lead him back 
 towards UNK-185 park . he UNK-20 almost UNK-899 and pressed UNK-8 arm 
 with an UNK-505 UNK-874 . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-650 indeed ! he said . is it you ? you poor poet you ! 
 UNK-0 
 and you made me UNK-313 to you stephen said UNK-892 by his touch 
 as i have UNK-964 to you so many other things have i not ? 
 UNK-0 
 yes my child UNK-12 said still UNK-219 . 
 UNK-0 
 you made me UNK-313 the fears that i have . but i will tell you also 
 what i do not fear . i do not fear to be alone or to be UNK-87 for 
 another or to leave whatever i have to leave . and i am not afraid to 
 make a mistake even a great mistake a UNK-834 mistake and perhaps 
 as long as UNK-162 too . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 now grave again UNK-543 his pace and said 
 UNK-0 
 alone quite alone . you have no fear of that . and you know what that 
 word means ? not only to be separate from all others but to have not 
 even one friend . 
 UNK-0 
 i will take the risk said stephen . 
 UNK-0 
 and not to have any one person UNK-12 said who would be more than 
 a friend more even than the UNK-149 and UNK-591 friend a man ever had . 
 UNK-0 
 his words seemed to have struck some deep UNK-774 in his own nature . had 
 he spoken of himself of himself as he was or UNK-136 to be ? stephen 
 watched his face for some moments in silence . a cold UNK-750 was there . 
 he had spoken of himself of his own UNK-964 which he UNK-60 . 
 UNK-0 
 of whom are you speaking ? stephen asked at length . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-12 did not answer . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0 
 march UNK-500 . long talk with UNK-12 on the subject of my UNK-978 . 
 UNK-0 
 he had his grand manner on . i UNK-823 and UNK-144 . attacked me on the 
 score of love for ones mother . tried to imagine his mother UNK-216 . 
 told me once in a moment of UNK-881 his father was UNK-551 
 when he was born . can see him . strong farmer type . pepper and salt 
 suit . square feet . UNK-846 UNK-635 UNK-153 . probably UNK-15 UNK-500 
 matches . pays his UNK-76 regularly but not UNK-812 to father UNK-495 of 
 UNK-900 . sometimes talks to girls after UNK-351 . but his mother ? very 
 young or very old ? hardly the first . if so UNK-12 would not have 
 spoken as he did . old then . probably and UNK-377 . hence UNK-368 
 UNK-85 of soul the child of UNK-412 UNK-577 . 
 UNK-0 
 march UNK-194 morning . thought this in bed last night but was too lazy and 
 free to add to it . free yes . the UNK-412 UNK-577 are those of 
 elizabeth and UNK-164 . then he is the UNK-5 . item he UNK-379 UNK-430 
 belly bacon and dried UNK-391 . read UNK-216 and wild honey . also when 
 thinking of him saw always a UNK-977 UNK-509 head or death mask as if 
 outlined on a grey UNK-622 or UNK-98 . UNK-338 they call it in the 
 gold . UNK-555 for the moment by saint john at the latin gate . what do i 
 see ? a UNK-27 UNK-312 trying to pick the lock . 
 UNK-0 
 march UNK-194 night . free . soul free and fancy free . let the dead UNK-721 the 
 dead . UNK-42 . and let the dead UNK-454 the dead . 
 UNK-0 
 march UNK-760 . in company with UNK-15 followed a UNK-898 hospital nurse . 
 UNK-179 idea . UNK-279 it . two lean hungry UNK-34 walking after a 
 UNK-299 . 
 UNK-0 
 march UNK-193 . have not seen her since that night . UNK-320 ? UNK-805 at the fire 
 perhaps with UNK-927 UNK-975 on her UNK-61 . but not UNK-404 . a nice 
 bowl of UNK-663 ? UNK-19 you now ? 
 UNK-0 
 march UNK-198 . began with a discussion with my mother . subject b UNK-335 UNK-462 . 
 UNK-791 by my sex and youth . to escape held up relations between 
 jesus and UNK-758 against those between mary and her son . said religion 
 was not a UNK-483 hospital . mother UNK-366 . said i have a UNK-81 mind 
 and have read too much . not true . have read little and understood less . 
 then she said i would come back to faith because i had a UNK-741 mind . 
 this means to leave church by back door of sin and UNK-40 through the 
 UNK-50 of UNK-473 . UNK-216 UNK-350 . told her so and asked for 
 UNK-547 . got UNK-865 . 
 UNK-0 
 then went to college . other UNK-239 with little round head UNK-757 eye 
 UNK-504 . this time about UNK-323 the UNK-461 . began in italian and ended in 
 UNK-25 english . he said UNK-323 was a terrible UNK-637 . i said he was 
 UNK-313 UNK-416 . he agreed to this with some UNK-234 . then gave me 
 recipe for what he calls UNK-427 UNK-618 UNK-118 . when he UNK-257 a 
 soft o he UNK-848 his full UNK-37 lips as if he UNK-166 the UNK-864 . has 
 he ? and could he UNK-350 ? yes he could and cry two round UNK-757 
 tears one from each eye . 
 UNK-0 
 crossing UNK-8 that is my green remembered that his UNK-574 
 and not mine had UNK-480 what UNK-12 the other night called our 
 religion . a UNK-46 of them soldiers of the UNK-199 UNK-51 
 UNK-673 sat at the foot of the cross and UNK-481 up dice for the 
 UNK-319 of the UNK-159 . 
 UNK-0 
 went to library . tried to read three reviews . UNK-453 . she is not out 
 yet . am i UNK-720 ? about what ? that she will never be out again . 
 UNK-0 
 blake wrote 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  i wonder if william bond will die 
 UNK-0  UNK-0  for UNK-963 he is very ill . 
 UNK-0 
 UNK-194 poor william ! 
 UNK-0 
 i was once at a UNK-634 in UNK-888 . at the end were pictures of big 
 UNK-891 . among them william UNK-872 UNK-779 just then dead . orchestra 
 played o UNK-638 we have missed you . 
 UNK-0 
 a race of UNK-384 ! 
 UNK-0 
 march UNK-115 morning . a UNK-371 night of dreams . want to get them off my 
 chest . 
 UNK-0 
 a long UNK-746 gallery . from the floor UNK-770 UNK-552 of dark UNK-171 . 
 it is UNK-572 by the images of fabulous kings set in stone . their 
 hands are UNK-177 upon their UNK-111 in token of UNK-890 and their eyes 
 are UNK-554 for the errors of men go up before them for ever as dark 
 UNK-171 . 
 UNK-0 
 strange figures advance as from a cave . they are not as tall as men . 
 one does not seem to stand quite apart from another . their faces are 
 UNK-146 with UNK-13 UNK-24 . they peer at me and their eyes 
 seem to ask me something . they do not speak . 
 UNK-0 
 march UNK-202 . this evening UNK-12 was in the UNK-372 of the library 
 UNK-564 a problem to UNK-110 and her brother . a mother let her child 
 fall into the UNK-320 . still UNK-577 on the mother . a UNK-384 UNK-457 the 
 child . mother asked it back . UNK-384 said all right if she told him 
 what he was going to do with the child eat it or not eat it . 
 UNK-0 
 this UNK-745 UNK-868 would say is indeed UNK-338 out of your mud by 
 the operation of your sun .
