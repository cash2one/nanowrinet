<!-- Explanation of what NaNoWriNet is -->
<template name="explanation">
<img src="meme.png" class="meme" >
<p>NaNoWriMo can be very draining. It is incredibly frustrating to be less than 10 000 words away from finishing... before being swamped by work and Thanksgiving relatives and college reunions and explaining the plot to the internet and, also, webcomics. You got so far, though. Don't stop now! All this progress has got to count for something...</p>
